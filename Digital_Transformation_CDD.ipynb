The Khyex River Landslide occurred on November 28, between 00:20 and 00:30 PST. This is when Pacific Northern Gas Ltd noticed a pressure loss in the pipeline. Approximately 300 metres of 8-inch pipeline was lost. As a result, most of Prince Rupert residents were without natural gas or heat for 10 days. A few days after the landslide occurred, a temporary 2-inch gas line was installed to restore partial service. The spectacular landslide flowed downstream, crossed the river and flowed upstream for hundreds of metres. This type of landslide took place in very sensitive glaciomarine muds, and is called a retrogressive earthflow. The estimated volume of material displaced by the landslide is up to 4.7 million cubic metres. It is thought that the slope failure was triggered by erosion of the riverbank.\\t0\\t0\\t0\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t11/28/2003 12:00:00 AM\\t0.0000\\t0.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tBiological\\tEpidemic\\tAcross Canada, largely in the Greater Toronto area\\t3/13/2003 12:00:00 AM\\tAcross Canada, 13 March to August, 2003.

A spate of fierce thunderstorms broke out across southwestern, southcentral and eastern Ontario. Winds at Toronto Pearson International Airport gusted to 115 km/h, the strongest wind gusts reported since January 1978. Power lines and trees came down across the province, knocking out power to 100,000 customers (300,000 individuals).  Embedded in the thunderstorm cluster were marble-sized hail near Parry Sound, waterspouts in the Ottawa River, straight-line winds and weak tornados in Windsor and Ottawa. In Windsor, the roof was ripped off a union hall building with chunks of roofing and shards of glass littering the lawn and front steps. At Ottawa\\'s Rockcliffe Flying Club, winds damaged 18 planes. Both tornados were F0 in intensity with winds of up to 110 km/h.\\t0\\t0\\t0\\t40981000.0000\\t2149353.1\\t4/25/2009 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t40981000.0000\\t\\t300000\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tStorm Surge\\tTuktoyaktuk and Mackenzie Delta NT\\t9/23/1993 12:00:00 AM\\tTuktoyaktuk and Mackenzie Delta NT, September 22, 1993.

A super cell storm developed just south of Lake Huron and tracked northeastward for a remarkable 200 kilometres. The heat and humidity in Ontario increased once the clouds disappeared. A squall line developed over Lower Michigan and traveled across the Great Lakes reaching southern Ontario at 15:00 EDT. This system produced powerful winds from Windsor to northeast of Toronto as well as destructive tornadoes in Vaughan and Newmarket. While these tornadoes were wreaking havoc just north of Toronto, another series of super cell thunderstorms spawned tornadoes in parts of Simcoe County, Muskoka and Parry Sound Districts to the east of Georgian Bay and north towards Lake Nipissing. In total, the day?s weather produced 19 confirmed tornadoes, including: four F0, eleven F1, and four F2. This was the greatest number of F2 tornadoes in Ontario in one day since the Barrie/central Ontario tornadoes of May 31, 1985. It was also a new Canadian record for the most confirmed tornadoes in one day. Violent winds snapped trees, lifted roofs, flattened cars, mowed down fences, collapsed farm buildings, and inflicted property losses around $100 million. The first tornado of the day touched down in the town of Durham in Grey County, killing a young boy as he left a nearby conservation area day camp. About 600 homes, mostly in the communities of Maple and Woodbridge were damaged. Fourty were destroyed and declared unsafe. At the peak of the storm, Hydro One reported that 69,000 customers (approximately 207,000 individuals) had lost power.\\t1\\t0\\t0\\t96183000.0000\\t5044562.9\\t8/20/2009 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t96183000.0000\\t\\t207000\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tStorms and Severe Thunderstorms\\tSouthern Alberta\\t8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM\\tSouthern Alberta, August 1-3, 2009.

The powerful winds brought down a stage at the Big Valley Jamboree in Camrose killing one individual and injuring 75 others. Calgary received wind gusts of up to 78 km/h. The strong winds killed a small child and injured two others when debris from a construction site struck the individuals. On August 2 and 3, a powerful storm developed increasing the severity of the strong winds with wind gusts of up to 107 km/h, along with large hail and heavy rain. The power winds downed trees and power lines, knocking out power to an unknown number of people. In some parts of Alberta, hail was measured at 10 cm deep, with some hail the size of baseballs. Hail caused extensive damages to homes and vehicles.\\t2\\t77\\t0\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t8/3/2009 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t10000\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tNotre-Dame-des-Prairies QC\\t6/28/2009 12:00:00 AM\\tNotre-Dame-des-Prairies QC, June 28 to July 4, 2009. A quasi-stationary low-pressure system stalled over eastern Ontario and Quebec. Excessive rains of up to 140 mm damaged roads and bridges, and flooded basements.  The hardest hit areas were in Charlevoix, Mauricie and Parent. Flood waters filled 50 houses in Notre-Dame-des-Prairies on July 1, and collapsed a street in Entrelacs when a stream overflowed. The flow rate on several rivers exceeded historic records.\\t0\\t0\\t0\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t7/4/2009 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tStorms and Severe Thunderstorms\\tHamilton and Toronto ON\\t7/26/2009 12:00:00 AM\\tHamilton and Toronto ON, July 26, 2009. A storm cell stalled over the western end of Lake Ontario. Hamilton was hard hit. Waves of thunderstorms pounded the city, leaving citizens with flooded basements and motorists stuck in traffic caused by road closures. The midday downpour turned Red Hill Creek into an angry brown torrent that forced the closure of nearby roads and highways. Water gushed into 7000 basements and power was shut off to thousands of customers. While the Hamilton Airport observed only 28 mm of rain, radar estimates confirmed rainfall amounts in an unofficial gauge totaling 110 mm in two hours - worse than a 100-year storm and one of the most intense short-duration rainfalls on record in Canada. Conditions were made worse because the ground was super-saturated from storms two days earlier. In Toronto, parts of Lakeshore Boulevard near the Exhibition grounds were submerged. To the north, a pair of giant sinkholes swallowed part of Finch Avenue West - big enough to hold a fleet of cars and deep enough to cover a four-storey building.\\t0\\t0\\t0\\t173312000.0000\\t9089790.2\\t7/26/2009 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t173312000.0000\\t\\t0\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tStorm - Unspecified / Other\\tMontreal, Alma, La Tuque and Baie-Saint-Paul QC\\t5/14/2009 12:00:00 AM\\tMontreal, Alma, La Tuque and Baie-Saint-Paul QC, May 14, 2009.

Strong winds cut electricity to 70,000 people by downing hydro lines.  Winds also inflicted significant property damage: in Ste-Julie, winds uprooted hundreds of trees and tossed a gazebo and trampoline into the air where there were left dangling from power lines; in Alma, fallen trees crossed power lines, igniting a brush fire; in the La Tuque region, winds blew shingles off a hotel roof and dropped a street light on a home; and in Baie-Saint-Paul, winds snapped hydro poles in half and tore away roofs.\\t0\\t0\\t0\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t5/14/2009 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t70000\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tSaint John, Miramichi and Restigouche River NB\\t4/5/2009 12:00:00 AM\\tSaint John, Miramichi and Restigouche River NB, April 5 to May 4, 2009. A freshet in spring 2009 caused flooding in a number of communities, primarily from the formation of ice jams which raised water levels along the Saint John, Miramichi, and Restigouche rivers from April 5 to May 4.  The flooding caused damages to homes, businesses and infrastructure such as roadways.

At 13:41 EDT, a magnitude 5.0 earthquake occurred near Val-des-Bois. The effects of the earthquake were mostly felt in Ontario and Quebec, although some tremors were felt in the United States as far as Kentucky. The earthquake caused the strongest shaking experienced in Ottawa for over 200 years. The depth of the earthquake was 22 kilometres and it lasted about 20 to 30 seconds. The earthquake caused significant damages to roads in Quebec, including a collapsed bridge on highway 307 near Bowman and the closure of a bridge on highway 105 in Gracefield. There were also two landslides in Quebec caused by the earthquake as well as damages to commercial and residential property. Approximately 300 households near the epicentre lost power for about an hour. A state of emergency was called in Gracefield, but was lifted on June 26.\\t0\\t0\\t0\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t6/23/2010 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t900\\t5.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tTornado\\tD?l?age and Mont-Laurier QC\\t8/4/2009 12:00:00 AM\\tD?l?age and Mont-Laurier QC, August 4, 2009. A powerful F2 tornado touched down in D?l?age at 14:00 EST and track 40 kilometres through Aumond, to Mont-Laurier in the upper Laurentians. The tornado blew away roofs, knocked down walls, flipped over cars, snapped utility poles and downed power lines leaving 4000 residents (12,000 individuals) without power. In Mont-Laurier, 40 homes were damaged, amoung those 28 were rendered uninhabitable. There were no fatalities, although two people were injured and taken to the hospital. The tornado caused about $6 million in insured losses. The tornado\\'s path through Mont-Laurier was 300 metres wide, but its 40 kilometre track was an unusually long distance for a tornado in Quebec and a strong indication of the storm\\'s severity. Previous to this event, the last time a stronger tornado touched down in the Quebec was on the same day in 1994 when an F3 tornado destroyed more than 400 homes in Aylmer.\\t0\\t0\\t0\\t6000000.0000\\t314685.3\\t8/4/2009 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t6000000.0000\\t\\t12000\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tStorms and Severe Thunderstorms\\tWinnipeg and Steinbach MB\\t8/14/2009 12:00:00 AM\\tWinnipeg and Steinbach MB, August 14, 2009.

An intense low pressure system caused heavy rainfall from July 23-25, affecting an area of northern Saskatchewan already saturated by snowmelt between Meadow Lake to the south and Stony Rapids to the north, and between the Alberta border to the west and the Manitoba border to the east.  The closure of Highway 905 due to flooding in several locations resulted in the disruption of services to northern communities, including Stony Rapids and Black Lake, until the road was re-opened on July 31.  Preliminary eligible costs were estimated at $3,200,000, which would result in a federal share of approximately $1,100,000.\\t0\\t0\\t0\\t2597891.0000\\t145676.1\\t7/25/2005 12:00:00 AM\\t497891.0000\\t2100000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tWildfire\\tHaileybury ON\\t9/30/1922 12:00:00 AM\\tHaileybury and northern region ON, September 30 - October 5 1922. 43 dead (unofficially as high as 150), 11,000 homeless, 5180 square kilometres burned.\\t43\\t0\\t11000\\t\\t\\t10/5/1922 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tRoseau River First Nation, Sioux Falls, Peguis First Nation, St. Andrews, St. Clements and Selkirk MB\\t3/24/2009 12:00:00 AM\\tRoseau River First Nation, Sioux Falls, Peguis First Nation, St. Andrews, St. Clements and Selkirk MB, March 24 to May 21, 2009. Overland flooding caused by a combination of snowmelt, seasonal precipitation and the spring breakup affected southern Manitoba\\'s watershed areas of the Red, Pembina, Assiniboine, and Souris Rivers. The event caused flooding of houses and evacuations from communities including Roseau River First Nation, Sioux Falls, Peguis First Nation, St. Andrews, St. Clements and Selkirk. The flooding also resulted in damage to public infrastructure such as bridges, roads, and highways. Three principal factors led to the spring flooding: 1) Heavy autumn rains, about 43 per cent more than normal, saturated the ground just before freezing in early December, which left little room for absorbing snow melt in the spring; 2) It was a snowy winter in southern Manitoba with some 25 per cent more snowfall than normal. Heavy snowfalls and copious spring rains swelled the critical headwaters of North Dakota sending excessive waters north into Canada via the Red River and its tributaries; and, 3) An unseasonably cold spring slowed basin snow melting, ice decaying in rivers, and overland flow from ditches and culverts.\\t0\\t0\\t3000\\t76506000.0000\\t4012552.4\\t5/21/2009 12:00:00 AM\\t70006000.0000\\t6500000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tDrought\\tSaskatchewan and Alberta\\t3/1/2009 12:00:00 AM\\tSaskatchewan and Alberta, March 1 to July 1, 2009.  The Canadian Wheat Board projected lower crop prospects by 20 per cent across the Prairies. A dozen counties and municipal districts in Alberta declared a state of drought emergency or disaster. For example, Saskatoon had less than one-quarter of the usual amount of spring precipitation, making the months of March, April and May the driest since record-keeping began in 1892. It wasn\\'t just spring that was dry. The soil moisture recharge period between September 1, 2008 and March 31, 2009 had less than 60 per cent of normal precipitation. To the west, in Alberta, conditions were even drier, as illustrated by precipitation amounts in Edmonton, where the 12- month total rain and snow from July 2008 to June 2009 was only 234 mm, less than half of normal and the driest such period with records dating back to 1880. Making matters worse, eight of the last ten years in Alberta\\'s capital of Edmonton had less rain and snow than the 30-year average total, but no year was as scanty as the most recent. Not surprisingly, the flow of the North Saskatchewan River was at its third lowest level in nearly a century.\\t0\\t0\\t0\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tGeological\\tLandslide\\tEcho Harbour BC\\t9/30/1922 12:00:00 AM\\tEcho Harbour BC, September 30, 1922. 5 dead; debris avalanche caused by heavy rains destroyed a logging camp.\\t5\\t0\\t0\\t\\t\\t9/30/1922 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tExplosion\\tNon-Residential\\tComox BC\\t1/1/1923 12:00:00 AM\\tComox BC, 1923.

On May 25th, the two fires that contributed to the Mississagi Fire were initiated; one in the Mississagi River Valley and the other in the Chapleau area. By mid-June, the fire(s) had burned 202,342 ha (2,023 km2) and smoke was carried as far as Washington DC, and in some reports, as far as Texas. On June 7th, the two fires combined into one. There were extraordinary efforts to contain the fire, including cloud-seeding. The fire was finally under control on July 21st, and out on August 1st. The fire had burned 302,510 ha (3,025 km2) and affected 54 townships. There was only 1 fatality (a firefighter). While this was one of the largest fires in Ontario\\'s history, the Department of Forests and Lands undertook a salvage operation of fire-damaged timber and saved 300,000,000 foot board measure (fbm) of timber.\\t1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t8/1/1948 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tFraser River BC\\t5/31/1948 12:00:00 AM\\tFraser River BC, May 31, 1948.

A severe storm hit St. John\\'s with winds of up to 220 km/h and left 55 cm of snow on the ground.  An avalanche struck two houses and swept them down the slope, hitting two other houses.  Over 50 rescue workers and residents worked for 12 hours, digging through the snow and the debris to free trapped residents.  In the Outer Battery, another avalanche (caused by the same storm) buried a house that withheld the weight of the snow.  The strong structure protected the residents; however, they were trapped until dug out by rescue workers.  This was the second avalanche to affect The Battery in 40 years.  Inspection of the slopes has shown that a rockfall risk exists, and that The Battery is frequently affected by rockfalls.  The City of St. John\\'s has recently constructed safety fences to protect against rockfalls and avalanches in the Outer Battery area.\\t5\\t9\\t0\\t\\t\\t2/16/1959 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tExplosion\\tNon-Residential\\tWindsor, Ontario\\t10/25/1960 12:00:00 AM\\tJust after 2:00pm (local) on October 25th, there was a large explosion at the Metropolitan Store on Ouellette Avenue in Windsor, ON.

Leading up to the January 18th event, temperatures were in the -12 to -35 degrees Celsius range.  On the 18th, temperatures decreased further to the -30 to -40 degrees Celsius range.  Winds from the west were 65 km/hr with wind gusts up to 111 km/hr occurring during the evening hours.  This resulted in wind chills of -53 to -58 degrees Celsius.  Heavy snowfall and high winds reduced visibility to near zero, and were the cause of a power outage at the Harrie Lake Trailer Court.  The outage left residents without heat or hydro, and the extreme cold caused water pipes to freeze and burst within a majority of the residences.  The Mayor declared a local state of emergency, loaders and dump trucks were brought in to create access routes, and 2,000 residents of the trailer park were evacuated to A.P. Lowe School.\\t0\\t0\\t2000\\t\\t\\t1/19/1982 12:00:00 AM\\t0.0000\\t0.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tExplosion\\tNon-Residential\\tLodgepole AB\\t2/1/1982 12:00:00 AM\\tLodgepole AB, February 1982.

Earthquake ? A magnitude 9.0-9.1 earthquake struck off the coast of Honshu, Japan on March 11 at 14:46 local time. The earthquake had a depth of 24 kilometres and struck 129 kilometres outside the city of Sendai, 177 kilometres outside of Fukushima and some 372 kilometres northeast of Tokyo. Tsunami ? The earthquake triggered a massive tsunami with waves reaching as high as 40 metres and struck land as far as 10 kilometres inland. Close to 28,000 people were reported dead or missing as a result of the earthquake and tsunami. Japanese authorities estimated the number of people injured as a result of this disaster was over 4000.  Over 220,000 buildings were damaged or destroyed.  Costs of damages resulting from the earthquake and tsunami have been estimated at over $300 billion. Nuclear Emergency ? The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was severely damaged by the initial earthquake and subsequent tsunami that followed. A nuclear emergency was declared by Japanese authorities following problems with one of the cooling systems. These problems resulted in three major explosions at the Fukushima nuclear power plant resulting in a level 7 nuclear meltdown. The explosions took place at reactor 1 on March 12, reactor 3 on March 14, and reactor 2 on March 15. On March 14, Japanese Prime Minister Kan announced that the 20 kilometre evacuation zone had been expanded to include a warning for people within 30 kilometres of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The Canadian federal department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) provided potassium Iodide (KI) to staff at the Canadian mission in Tokyo and Health Canada monitored gamma-radiation levels at the Embassy, confirming the absence of significant radiation meaning there was little threat to the health of Embassy staff. The Canadian government?s support to the government of Japan included a disaster victim identification team, chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear technical expertise and equipment, Canadian Armed Forces military assets to facilitate humanitarian relief efforts, relief stocks, and emergency medical and engineering capabilities. At the time of the earthquake, there were an estimated 11,000 Canadian citizens present in Japan. One Canadian citizen was confirmed to have been killed as a result of the earthquake and tsunami. Total cost estimated is over $300 billion.\\t1\\t\\t\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t3/11/2011 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t9.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tWildfire\\tSheshatshiu NL\\t6/23/2012 12:00:00 AM\\tNorth West River and Sheshatshiu NL, June 23-25, 2012.

A massive storm system crept through Alberta causing significant flooding throughout the province. As of 2013, this event was responsible for the largest evacuation due to a natural disaster in Alberta?s history. Beginning in northern Alberta, Fort McMurray declared a local state of emergency when water from the Hanging Stone River breached its banks on June 8. The storm then moved south on June 19, where it remained for three days over southern Alberta. Heavy rain spanning across a region from Canmore to Calgary produced an average of 75 to 150 mm during this three-day period. Twenty-nine local states of emergency were declared throughout the province. Four deaths were attributed to the floods, which caused significant disruptions across the province to power, telecommunications, clean water supply, and transportation corridors, including a section of the Trans-Canada Highway that closed due to a mudslide caused by the torrential rain. In Calgary the Bow and Elbow Rivers flooded, which forced 75,000 residents to evacuate the city. Over 4000 business were affected and 3000 buildings were flooded, including that Saddledome and the Calgary Zoo. The towns of High River and Canmore were also significantly impacted by the floods. In total, flooding forced the evacuations of approximately 100,000 Albertans. As flood conditions improved, some residents were allowed to gradually return to their communities beginning on June 23, while the remaining residents were allowed to return by June 28. Response to the flood was provided by municipal, provincial, and federal governments and non-governmental organizations. Insurance payments are estimated at $1.2 billion. This disaster is estimated to have reduced Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Southern Alberta by $550 million (2013 dollars).\\t4\\t0\\t100000\\t2715742000.0000\\t132690977.2\\t6/28/2013 12:00:00 AM\\t1015742000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t1700000000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tWildfire\\tTimmins ON\\t5/24/2012 12:00:00 AM\\tTimmins ON, May 24 to June 07, 2012.

The dam for the tailings pond at the Imperial Metals Mount Polley copper and gold mine breached; releasing nearly 10 million cubic metres of water and 4.5 million cubic metres of contaminated slurry into nearby Polley Lake, Hazeltine Creek, Cariboo Creek and Quesnel Lake. On August 6, the Cariboo Regional District declared a local state of emergency in several nearby communities due to concerns over the quality of drinking water, affecting over 300 residents. By August 12, the BC Government lifted the ban on drinking water for many homes with the exception of those within 100 metres of the sediment deposit. A final report commissioned by the BC Government attributed the dam failure to a design flaw, where the foundation was built upon unstable glacial till, exacerbated by the dam being repeatedly raised and expanded.\\t0\\t0\\t0\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t8/12/2014 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t300\\t\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tConflict\\tTerrorist\\tShootings\\tOttawa ON\\t10/22/2014 12:00:00 AM\\tOttawa ON, Oct 22, 2014. At approximately 09:52 EDT, an armed gunman  pulled up in their vehicle to the Ottawa National War Memorial where three Canadian Armed Forces members were posted on Ceremonial Guard sentry duty. The assailant shot at Cpl. Nathan Cirillo striking him twice in the back and fatally wounding him. The assailant then fired at the other sentries as they fled towards the Parliament buildings; but neither of the other sentries were struck or injured. Pulling up to Parliament Hill, the assailant ran from their car and carjacked an idling Parliamentary vehicle on the hill. Members of the RCMP began pursuit as he pulled the vehicle up and ran into the front doors of Parliament. Upon entering, the assailant engaged in a struggle with House of Commons Security Guard Samearn Son, who was shot in the foot in the ensuing struggle. The assailant fled further into the Parliament buildings and was fatally shot by the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Commons, Kevin Vickers. In the ensuing search for additional shooters, many federal government buildings and offices were placed in lockdown. Public institutions such as the University of Ottawa and nearby schools were also placed in lockdown. There were false reports that a third shooting had taken place at the Rideau Centre Mall, fueled by high cellular phone and social media usage that also strained cell towers and communications infrastructure. Government employees were asked to restrict their Blackberry usage for emergencies only until the crisis was over to reduce burden on the system. The following day, Prime Minister Stephen Harper classified the attack as terrorism.\\t2\\t0\\t0\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t10/22/2014 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tFire\\tResidential\\tL?Isle-Verte QC\\t1/23/2014 12:00:00 AM\\tL?Isle-Verte QC, January 23 to February 1 , 2014. A fire broke out overnight in the kitchen of the R?sidence du Havre nursing home that housed 52 seniors with limited mobility. A combination of a lack of installed sprinklers and the wooden construction of the building contributed to the intensity of the fire. Twenty-eight bodies were recovered during the initial search and another four were classified as missing and presumed dead. There were 15 injuries mostly caused by smoke inhalation and carbon monoxide poisoning. In addition, two firefighters were treated for minor injuries. The official Coroner?s report issued February 2015 cited a lack of adequate evacuation and emergency plans, a lack of trained personnel on duty at the facility, and a delay in the firefighter response and backup as factors that contributed to the severity of the disaster. The fire was classified as an accident and no criminal investigation was commenced.\\t32\\t15\\t0\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t2/1/2014 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tNew Brunswick\\t4/15/2014 12:00:00 AM\\tNew Brunswick, April 15 to May 2, 2014. Spring flooding damaged more than 715 homes and businesses, roads, bridges, and other public infrastructure around the province. The majority of property damages were in and around Sussex and Sussex Corner, where 120 homes and 10 businesses were flooded. On April 16, a state of emergency was declared as water breached the banks of the St. John River, causing 1,450 people to evacuate their homes. In Perth-Andover, 23 patients were voluntarily evacuated and transferred to Upper River Valley Hospital. Throughout the rest of the province, swollen rivers led to the closure of several roads and localized flooding.\\t0\\t0\\t1473\\t29603000.0000\\t1418674.1\\t5/2/2014 12:00:00 AM\\t13603000.0000\\t\\t16000000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tConflict\\tTerrorist\\tKidnapping / Murder\\tSaint-Jean-sur-Richelieu QC\\t10/20/2014 12:00:00 AM\\tSaint-Jean-sur-Richelieu QC, October 20-21, 2014. At approximately 11:30 EDT, the lone assailant deliberately rammed their car into a pair of Canadian Armed Forces soldiers in a parking lot of a local shopping Centre, narrowly missing another soldier and a police officer. Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent was transported to hospital with life-threatening injuries and another un-named soldier sustained non-life threatening injuries. Warrant Officer Vincent succumbed to his injuries the next day in hospital. The assailant fled the scene chased by police officers. He eventually lost control of his car and was killed after charging a police officer with a knife. Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the RCMP classified this as a lone-wolf ISIL inspired terrorist attack, unconnected to the shooting on Parliament Hill only two days later.\\t2\\t1\\t0\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t10/21/2014 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tWinter Storm\\tQu?bec\\t12/21/2013 12:00:00 AM\\tQu?bec, December 21-26, 2013. A severe winter storm that formed over the Great Lakes region in Ontario tracked into Qu?bec bringing a mix of freezing rain, ice pellets and snow. The Eastern Townships region of the province was particularly impacted and at its peak, an estimated 51,000 Hydro Qu?bec customers were without power (153,000 individuals). The storm is attributed with the deaths of six people due to a mix of carbon monoxide poisoning and traffic accidents throughout the province. Power was fully restored to all customers by December 26, 2013.\\t6\\t\\t0\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t12/26/2013 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t153000\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tWinter Storm\\tSouthern Ontario\\t12/21/2013 12:00:00 AM\\tSouthern Ontario, ON, December 21, 2013 to January 1, 2014. A severe storm brought freezing rain and damaging ice accumulation across a large area of southern Ontario. According to Environment Canada, the epicentre of the freezing rain was in southern Ontario along the north shore of Lake Ontario, including the Greater Toronto Area, where ice accumulation reached up to 30 mm. The impact of the ice storm on these municipalities and conservation authorities was further exacerbated by freezing temperatures. The ice storm had serious impacts. In its aftermath, as many as 830,000 hydro customers (2,490,000 individuals) across Southern Ontario were without power for several days. Downed trees, broken branches, and downed wires resulting from ice accumulation posed serious public health and safety risks, as well as transportation network problems. Due to widespread power outages and freezing temperatures, municipalities activated emergency plans to open warming centres and canvassed homes of vulnerable residents to ensure their safety. Power was restored to most residences and businesses by January 1, 2014.\\nResponse and recovery activities began at the time of the event. The ice storm significantly impacted some of Canada?s largest and most densely populated urban municipalities. Municipalities, provincial ministries and non-governmental organizations such as the Red Cross all acted to respond to the ice storm. Ontario determined that the impacts of the storm were severe enough to warrant implementation of an Ice Storm Assistance Program to help municipalities and conservation authorities with emergency response and recovery costs. Two deaths were attributed to the storm due to carbon monoxide poisoning from improperly ventilated generators and heaters.  \\n\\n*Note: A request for federal assistance through the DFAA program has been made; however, no payments have yet been issued.\\t2\\t25\\t0\\t262781642.0000\\t12839493.9\\t1/1/2014 12:00:00 AM\\t98581642.0000\\t\\t4200000.0000\\t160000000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t2490000\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tCumberland House SK\\t4/29/2013 12:00:00 AM\\tCumberland House SK, April 29 to July 03, 2013. Higher-than-normal snow fall and lower temperatures delayed the annual spring melt until the end of April. Over 15 communities declared states of emergencies between April and June as flood waters rose throughout the province. Overland flooding occurred between Moose Jaw and Indian Head, including parts of Regina and south past Weyburn to the U.S border. Significant damage occurred on parts of Highways 2 and 3 that were washed out by the flood waters. Flood waters flowing east on the South Saskatchewan River from Alberta following the June 19 flash floods reached a peak flow of 6000 cubic metres per second, the highest ever recorded, flowing into the Lake Diefenbaker Reservoir. Between June 23 and 28 the Saskatchewan Water Security Agency began releasing water from the reservoir at a rate of 2000 cubic metres per second, leading to a two-metre rise in the river downstream. As a result, 2,200 residents of Cumberland House were evacuated to Prince Albert and Saskatoon. On July 3, 2013 the evacuation order was lifted and residents began to return to the community. \\n\\n*Note: A request for federal assistance through the DFAA program has been made.\\t0\\t0\\t3000\\t43309000.0000\\t2116074.9\\t7/3/2013 12:00:00 AM\\t43309000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tHurricane / Typhoon / Tropical Storm\\tQuebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island\\t7/5/2014 12:00:00 AM\\tQuebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island, July 5-6, 2014. Hurricane Arthur transformed into a powerful Post-Tropical storm over the Maritime provinces. The storm brought powerful wind gusts and heavy rain to Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. The most amount of rain was received in St. Stephen, New Brunswick where it rained up to 143 mm. The strongest winds were felt in Nova Scotia where in Greenwood wind gusts reached up to 140 km/h. In Quebec, severe flooding in Mont-Louis inundated several roads affecting 40 homes, while in Marsoui approximately 30 homes were evacuated (approximately 90 individuals). The powerful winds generated by the storm downed trees and power lines throughout the Maritimes causing power outages, property damage and infrastructure damage. Approximately 290,000 homes and businesses (870,000 individuals) in the Maritimes were without power, while in Quebec approximately 23,000 homes and businesses (69,000 individuals) were reported to have lost power.\\t0\\t0\\t90\\t24712000.0000\\t1184281.2\\t7/6/2014 12:00:00 AM\\t12212000.0000\\t\\t12500000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t939000\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tWinter Storm\\tOntario, Quebec and New Brunswick\\t12/20/2013 12:00:00 AM\\tOntario, Quebec and New Brunswick, December 20, 2013 to January 03, 2014. A severe winter storm system that formed over the Great Lakes Region caused significant damage in Ontario and Quebec before moving east bringing freezing rain, ice pellets, and snow to New Brunswick. Starting December 20, southern Ontario received 20-30 mm of freezing rain during a two-day period. In Quebec, 53,000 people lost power due to the freezing rain, which damaged power lines. By December 23, over 54,000 NB Power customers were without power. A second storm tracked north along the Atlantic coast, bringing up to 30 cm of snow, causing more power outages and delays, which complicated recovery efforts. In total, over 88,000 NB Power customers (approximately 264,000 individuals) lost power over an 11-day period, with the last restorations occurring on January 3, 2014. In total, 11 individuals died during the ice storm from either vehicle accidents or carbon monoxide poisoning from the use of gas generators.\\t0\\t0\\t0\\t214308000.0000\\t10471074.9\\t1/3/2014 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t214308000.0000\\t\\t317000\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tSouthern Quebec\\t4/14/2014 12:00:00 AM\\tQuebec, April 14 to May 1, 2014. A series of intense rainstorms deposited up to 75 mm of rain throughout parts of southern Quebec over a three-day period. Coupled with a delayed spring thaw, the rain caused ice jams and flooding along several rivers in the province. About 300 residents in Sainte-Raymond evacuated including residents from a senior?s home due to raising water levels in the Sainte-Anne River. Many homes situated near the Montmorency River along with homes in Trois-Rivieres, Lennoxville and Weedon were evacuated. In Sherbrooke 632 residents evacuated their homes as the Saint-Francois River reached a record peak of 7.5 metres.\\t0\\t0\\t1000\\t13064000.0000\\t626070.3\\t5/1/2014 12:00:00 AM\\t13064000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tSouthern Manitoba\\t6/25/2014 12:00:00 AM\\tSouthern Manitoba, June 25 to July 14, 2014. After a relatively quiet spring flood season, heavy rainfall in Western Manitoba and Saskatchewan led to record flows and flooding along the Assiniboine, Qu?Appelle and Souris Rivers. Up to 200 mm of rain fell in some municipalities. Over 43 local states of emergency were declared followed by a provincial state of emergency and formal request for federal assistance on July 4. Approximately 300 Canadian Armed Forces personnel deployed from CFB Shilo to help flood recovery efforts. The Portage Diversion was opened near Portage la Prairie to direct flows from the Assiniboine river into Lake Manitoba. In total, approximately 560 people were evacuated from their homes. The Government of Manitoba estimates that over 920,000 acres of farm land went unseeded for the 2014 season, representing 25 percent of arable acres in Manitoba with an associated estimated cost of over $1 billion dollars. \\n\\n*Note: A request for federal assistance through the DFAA program has been made; however, no payments have yet been issued.\\t0\\t0\\t560\\t1164679000.0000\\t55815287.5\\t7/14/2014 12:00:00 AM\\t164679000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t1000000000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tSouthern Saskatchewan\\t6/25/2014 12:00:00 AM\\tSouthern Saskatchewan, June 25 to July 14, 2014.

A major storm system formed off the United States east coast and moved towards the north Atlantic. On February 15, the storm system hit Nova Scotia bringing with it snow, ice and rain. In Halifax the weather changed from snow to rain, creating flooding in the streets, which turned into an overnight flash freeze. Greenwood, Nova Scotia received 56 cm of snow, while in Cape Breton Island wind gusts were recorded of up to 176 km/h. The next day in New Brunswick, heavy snow impacted Moncton where it snowed up to 58 cm. The hardest hit area was Prince Edward Island where it snowed over 80 cm in Charlottetown. During the storm, damages were caused by strong winds that downed trees and power lines leaving approximately 4000 customers (12,000 individuals) without power in New Brunswick. Flooding brought on by the rain also caused damages to city streets and created dangerous driving conditions as black ice formed when the temperature dropped. The huge amount of snow that fell on the region buried vehicles, left people stranded in their homes and resulted in the closure of numerous schools and businesses. In New Annan, Prince Edward Island 20 people were left homeless in blizzard conditions as fires irrupted in a motel where 18 people had to be evacuated as well as a home near Winsloe where two people had to be evacuated. In addition, an apartment fire in Fredericton resulted in the evacuation of one individual.\\t\\t\\t21\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t2/17/2015 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t12000\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tStorms and Severe Thunderstorms\\tFredericton NB\\t5/28/2015 12:00:00 AM\\tFredericton NB, May 28-29, 2015.

It was reported that 25 to 40 mm of rain fell in one hour and the storm produced wind gusts of up to 82 km/h. The storm that downed power lines and trees also produced a significant amount of lightening. It was reported that there were 319 lightning strikes within 50 kilometres of Fredericton.\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t5/29/2015 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t25000\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tPerth-Andover NB\\t4/18/2015 12:00:00 AM\\tPerth-Andover NB, April 18-20, 2015. Perth-Andover experienced significant flooding due to a massive ice jam that broke apart on the St. John and Tobique Rivers. Ice congested local waterways near the village of Perth-Andover causing water levels to rise. The flooding forced 300 people to evacuate. The Canadian Red Cross assisted with the evacuation order. Many businesses closed down, including schools and the local hospital where 23 patients staying at the Hotel Dieu of St. Joseph had to be relocated. Route 105, the major road into Perth-Andover, was closed due to the risk of overland flooding.\\t\\t\\t300\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t4/20/2015 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tStorms and Severe Thunderstorms\\tSouthern Manitoba\\t2/16/2015 12:00:00 AM\\tSouthern Manitoba, May 16-18, 2015. A Colorado low responsible for a tornado outbreak in the United States moved north into Manitoba where it merged with an Artic front. The combined systems created a storm that produced strong winds and heavy rain that eventually turned into ice pellets, snow and hail. On May 17, southern Manitoba was hit with heavy rain and isolated thunderstorms that produced wind gusts of 93 km/h in Winnipeg, 89 km/h in Gimli Harbour and 83 km/h near Brandon. Heavy rain was also reported with the heaviest areas receiving 90 mm in Melita and 83 mm in Bede. The Artic front lowered the temperature causing the rain to turn into freezing rain and snow. MacGregor and Teulon both received 15 cm of snow. Damages were caused by strong winds downing trees and power lines. Approximately 5000 people temporarily lost power during the weekend storm. Heavy rain and snowmelt also caused flooding in certain areas where damage was done to agricultural lands and cottage properties. In addition, the heavy rain caused sewage backups in Winnipeg.\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t2/18/2015 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t5000\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tWildfire\\tBritish Columbia\\t5/9/2015 12:00:00 AM\\tBritish Columbia, May 9 to September 11, 2015. The 2015 wildfire season in British Columbia was the worst on record, in terms of number of fires and hectares burned, to impact the province in 10 years. During the wildfire season that spanned from May to September, over 1,800 fires burned over 300,000 hectares of land. Approximately two thirds of the fires were caused by lighting. The season began early with the discovery of the Little Bobtail Lake fire on May 9. Many fires were within a close proximity of urban areas prompting evacuation orders and alerts across the province. A number of communities were affected by evacuation orders and alerts. Evacuation orders were issued for 141 homes in Joe Rich Kelowna, 70 homes in West Kelowna, 150 homes in Port Hardy and 110 homes in Testalinden, including others. In Puntzi Lake, 90 homes were evacuated and 18 structures were destroyed, while in Rock Creek 330 homes were evacuated and 30 homes as well as 15 other structures were destroyed. Across the province, 1,144 homes (approximately 3,432 individuals) were evacuated due to wildfires. BC Hydro was forced to cut power to certain communities as a precaution, like in West Kelowna where power was cut to 100 customers (approximately 300 individuals). Additional personnel and resources were needed to help battle to above average number of fires burning throughout the province including 310 out-of province firefighters as well as firefighters from Australia, South Africa and the United states. In total, 2,500 firefighters and support workers were working across the province during the peak of the wildfire season. One man was fatally injured while felling a danger tree at the Old Sechelt Mine fire.\\t1\\t\\t3432\\t20401000.0000\\t966872.0\\t9/11/2015 12:00:00 AM\\t20401000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t300\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tStorm - Unspecified / Other\\tLower Mainland British Columbia\\t8/29/2015 12:00:00 AM\\tLower Mainland British Columbia, August 29, 2015. One of the worst windstorms to affect the province in decades hit British Columbia?s Lower Mainland. The most affected areas included Surrey, Richmond, Abbotsford and the Western Fraser Valley. On Saturna Island, wind gusts were report to reached 117 km/h. The powerful winds subsequently fell hundreds of trees, which damaged homes, vehicles and power lines. In total, approximately 500,000 customers (1,500,000 individuals) lost power due to damaged power lines. Some areas lost power temporarily, while others were without power for over three days. Fallen trees caused damages to residential and commercial property. Debris and traffic light outages created severe traffic congestion. There were numerous reports of an undetermined number of people being injured due to fallen trees and debris. One individual was critically injured and taken to the hospital after a tree fell on her while she was outside with her daughter. Additionally, a Vancouver Sky Train was damaged by a fallen tree resulting in service delays. The strong winds that fell hundreds of trees also caused the closure of Stanley Park, Pacific National Exhibition (PNE) and ferry crossings.\\t\\t1\\t\\t34768000.0000\\t1647772.5\\t8/29/2015 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t34768000.0000\\t\\t1500000\\t\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tHazardous Chemicals\\tLeak / Spill Release\\tVancouver BC\\t4/8/2015 12:00:00 AM\\tVancouver BC, April 8, 2015. The MV Marathassa leaked 2,700 litres of bunker C fuel into the Vancouver English Bay. Spreading through Vancouver Harbour to Burrard Inlet, the oil spill contaminated many of Vancouver\\'s shorelines including Second Beach and English Bay Beach. Several beaches were closed and residents were instructed not to come in contact with the toxic oil. The leak was relatively small but had a significant negative impact on the water quality, local wildlife and environment. According to researchers of the Vancouver Aquarium Marine Science Centre Ocean Pollution Research Program, sediment samples collected from the sites of Second Beach and English Bay exceeded Canadian environmental quality guidelines for aquatic life conservation.\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t4/8/2015 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tStorms and Severe Thunderstorms\\tPrairie Provinces\\t6/12/2015 12:00:00 AM\\tPrairie Provinces, June 12, 2015. A massive storm system moved through the prairies causing severe thunderstorms to occur throughout the prairie provinces starting in central Alberta and Saskatchewan. Parts of southern Alberta experienced thunderstorms including High River, Brooks and Taber. The storm intensified near Medicine Hat where there was hail and strong winds that caused damages throughout the city. Approximately 9000 people in Alberta lost power due to downed power lines. The storm later moved into Saskatchewan near maple Creek with hail and estimated wind gusts of up to 120 km/h. As the storm travelled eastward, Assiniboia and Weyburn sustained damages from hail. A large part of the storm moved into Manitoba, bringing heavy rain, strong winds and hail that impacted Virden causing extensive damages.\\t\\t\\t\\t98184000.0000\\t4653270.1\\t6/12/2015 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t98184000.0000\\t\\t9000\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tStorms and Severe Thunderstorms\\tAlberta and Saskatchewan\\t7/22/2015 12:00:00 AM\\tAlberta and Saskatchewan, July 22, 2015. Severe thunderstorms affected the southern Alberta region before moving into Saskatchewan. A storm system southwest of Calgary produced a small tornado that touched down in the Tsuu T?ina Nation at 12:53 MTZ as well as multiple funnel clouds, which were spotted in the Calgary area. The impact of the tornado was minimal, however the proximity of the tornado to a highly populated area like Calgary created an extremely high level of risk. Southern areas of Calgary including Canyon Meadows and Lake Bonavista were hit with large hail and as the storm moved east, Hussar, Patricia and Strathmore were impacted by strong wind gusts that downed trees over power lines resulting in localized power outages. A severe thunderstorm warning was in effect at the time meaning that wind gusts exceeded 90 km/h and hail was greater than two cm. The storm later reached Saskatchewan where the town of Kerrobert was hit with severe hail, prompting a state of emergency to be declared. Other communities in Saskatchewan such as Anglin Lake, Francis, Sedley and Regina were impacted by strong winds, heavy rain, hail and lighting. Golf-ball sized hail caused the most significant damages during the storm, including damages to roofs, windows and vehicles.\\t\\t\\t\\t45676000.0000\\t2164739.3\\t7/22/2015 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t45676000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tStorms and Severe Thunderstorms\\tSouthern Alberta\\t8/4/2015 12:00:00 AM\\tSouthern Alberta, August 4-5, 2015. A severe thunderstorm warning was in place for much of southern Alberta including tornado warnings. On August 4, a storm cell that produced low to moderate levels of hail formed in the Elbow valley and later moved into the northern regions of Calgary just as a second storm cell headed towards the southern region of the city. Both storm cells formed one large storm system that hit the Calgary area with severe hail. As the storm system move out of Calgary, the village of Standard was impacted by small hail and there were reports of a tornado sighting in Langdon that caused minimal damages. On August 05, the Calgary area was hit again by bad weather. In Calgary there was significant rainfall and wind gusts of up to 78 km/h. Flooding occurred in the city where it had rained up to 100 mm since the previous storm. Over all, both storms produced strong winds that caused damages to the roofs of apartment buildings and residential homes. Approximately 35,000 customers (105,000 individuals) lost power due to damaged power lines from fallen trees. Heavy rain and hail also caused flooding that submerged basements, vehicles and underpasses.\\t\\t\\t\\t167236000.0000\\t7925876.8\\t8/5/2015 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t167236000.0000\\t\\t105000\\t\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tHazardous Chemicals\\tLeak / Spill Release\\tLong Lake AB\\t6/29/2015 12:00:00 AM\\tLong Lake AB, June 29 to July 22, 2015. A massive oil leak was detected at the Nexen Long Lake oil sands facility in Northern Alberta on July 15, but officials believe that the spill may have started as early as June 29. About 5 million litres of bitumen, sand and wastewater leaked into the Long Lake site contaminating 16,000 square metres of land. The leak caused significant damage to the environment and local wildlife.\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t7/22/2015 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tChestermere AB\\t7/12/2015 12:00:00 AM\\tChestermere AB, July 12, 2015.

In late September, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) discovered a case of bovine tuberculosis (TB) found in a cow from Alberta. The USDA then contacted the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) whom initiated an investigation into the outbreak. The investigation found that one herd of cattle in Alberta was infected with TB. The one infected herd was located on 18 separate properties. Within the infected herd there were six confirmed cases of TB, including the cow that was slaughtered in the United states. The infection resulted in the quarantine of approximately 26,000 cattle from approximately 50 different properties in both Alberta and Saskatchewan. As a precaution, approximately 10,000 cattle were destroyed in order to stop the spread of the infection. The infection significantly impacted farmers in Alberta and Saskatchewan. The federal government of Canada offered to pay up to $16.7 million for ranchers who suffered agricultural loses due to the TB outbreak.\\t\\t\\t\\t16700000.0000\\t780373.8\\t12/21/2016 12:00:00 AM\\t16700000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tHazardous Chemicals\\tLeak / Spill Release\\tNorth Saskatchewan River SK\\t7/21/2016 12:00:00 AM\\tNorth Saskatchewan River SK, July 21, 2016. A pipeline from Husky Energy Inc. ruptured spilling up to 250,000 litres of oil mixed with diluent into the North Saskatchewan River. Signs of the leak were first detected on July 20, however after an initial inspection crews reported that no leak was found. The next day the pipeline was shut off as a precaution, after a few hours oil was spotted in the river and an emergency response team was dispatched. The leak that spread hundreds of kilometres downstream contaminated the waterways of the North Saskatchewan River, which is the primary water source for many communities. On July 23 and 25, the contaminated water reached North Battleford and Prince Albert, where a state of emergency was declared, causing both communities to shut off their water supply intake. In addition, the city of Melfort and the town of Star City were put on a boil-water advisory. Multiple First Nation communities were affected including Muskaday First Nation, which declared a state of local emergency on July 27. As of July 29, oil ceased to be released from the source site and the spill was 40-50 per cent recovered. The spill caused severe environmental damages and clean-up efforts ran the risk of disrupting approximately 3000 archaeological sites located along the waterways.\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t7/21/2016 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tRed Earth First Nation SK\\t11/14/2016 12:00:00 AM\\tRed Earth First Nation SK, July 14-18, 2016.

Delta?s Tilbury Industrial Park, which is comprised of 25 commercial businesses, was evacuated on July 3 and workers were unable to return until July 6. A section of Highway 17, from Highway 99 to the Highway 91 connector, temporarily closed as the fire burned dangerously close to the road. Burns Bog is the largest raised peat bog and the largest undeveloped urban land mass in the North American west coast. Officials predict that it could take up to a century for the bog to be completely restored.\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t7/6/2016 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tStorm - Unspecified / Other\\tSouth Coast and Lower Mainland British Columbia\\t10/12/2016 12:00:00 AM\\tSouth Coast and Lower Mainland British Columbia, October 12-16, 2016. The remnants of Super Typhoon Songda hit British Columbia?s southern coast with a trio of fall storms. The first storm occurred on October 12 and pounded the coast with heavy rain before moving across the Lower Mainland early the next day. The storm brought 80 to 100 mm of rain to Howe Sound and Metro Vancouver. In North Vancouver, the heavy rain poured hard enough to down a tree, which damaged one residents home and a vehicle. The second and third storms arrived on October 14 and 15, which brought more strong wind and heavy rain to the region. A wind warning was issued for Greater Victoria, where there were wind gusts of up to 90 km/h. Powerful winds downed trees and power lines knocking out power to 75,000 B.C. Hydro customers (approximately 225,000 individuals) across Vancouver Island and the Lower Mainland. A fallen tree struck and killed a 15 year old by near Clayton Heights. In total, during the course of the three storms, there were 250 downed trees in Vancouver and 202 mm of rain had accumulated in North Vancouver.\\t1\\t\\t\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t10/16/2016 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t225000\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tStorm - Unspecified / Other\\tSouth Coast and Lower Mainland British Columbia\\t10/6/2016 12:00:00 AM\\tSouth Coast and Lower Mainland British Columbia, October 6-8, 2016. Strong winds gusting up to 117 km/h battered eastern Vancouver Island, the Sunshine Coast and the Lower Mainland. On October 6, Vancouver reported wind gusts of 56 km/h, Victoria 36 km/h, and Sisters Island as well as Trail Island both recorded wind gusts of 117 km/h. Severe winds downed trees and power lines, which knocked out power to 100,000 B.C. Hydro customers (approximately 300,000 individuals). In eastern Victoria Island 29,000 people lost power over night. The most severely impacted area was Courtenay where 12,000 people were without power. At the peak of the storm, 45,000 people lost power throughout the province. By October 8, 13,000 people were still without power and strong winds continued to affect parts of the province.\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t10/8/2016 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t300000\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tStorm - Unspecified / Other\\tSouth Coast and Lower Mainland British Columbia\\t3/9/2016 12:00:00 AM\\tSouth Coast and Lower Mainland British Columbia, March 9-10, 2016. A storm system off the coast of British Columbia generated a windstorm that impacted Vancouver Island, the southwest coast and the lower mainland. The storm produced up to 100 mm of rain and wind gusts of over 100 km/h in some parts. Heavy rainfall caused localized flooding in Comox Valley, Port Mellon and Port Alberni as well as caused a mudslide in Cowichan Valley. Strong winds and high tide contributed towards a storm surge that accompanied the storm, causing coastal flooding in Delta, Richmond and White Rock. The strong winds were attributed for causing the most significant damages including fallen trees that downed power lines, resulting in 160,000 BC Hydro customer (approximately 480,000 individuals) being without power. Due to the power outages, 11 schools in Surrey, five in Abbotsford and five in Mission were closed. The powerful winds also damaged roofs, broke windows and even flipped over a Cessna aircraft. In addition, one individual in Port Moody was killed when a tree crashed through the roof of her home while she was inside.\\t1\\t\\t\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t3/10/2016 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t480000\\t\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tHazardous Chemicals\\tLeak / Spill Release\\tSeaforth Channel BC\\t10/13/2016 12:00:00 AM\\tSeaforth Channel BC, October 13, 2016. The articulated barge and tug, Nathan E. Stewart, ran aground near Bella Bella in the Seaforth Channel. The tug, which contained 215,000 litres of diesel, began taking on water resulting in the empty barge breaking free from the tug. The tug was partially submerged and two of its fuel tanks were breached causing fuel to leak into the waters off the coast of the Great Bear Rainforest. The barge and tug, which were owned by the U.S. company Kirby Offshore Marine, were travelling south from Alaska. On October 14, two aerial flights confirmed that the sheen had spread throughout the Gale passage. Protection and containment efforts consisted of absorbent booms that were deployed around the damaged tug and booming along the Gale Passage, which included the application of petroleum sorbent. A dive team partially repaired sections of the breached fuel tanks to reduce the leakage while workers attempted to pump out the remaining fuel inside. Clean up and salvage recovery efforts were hindered by bad weather. It was not until November 15 when the tug was finally lifted out of the water and taken to shore on a salvage barge. It is estimated that 108,000 litres of fuel and 2,240 litres of lubricants were spilled. Most impacted by the leak was the Heiltsuk First Nation who closed local clam fisheries due to environmental concerns.\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t10/13/2016 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tNortheastern British Columbia\\t6/15/2016 12:00:00 AM\\tNortheastern British Columbia, June 15-17, 2016.

In May 2016, wildfires broke out in northern Alberta resulting in the most expensive natural disaster in the history of Canada. The city of Fort McMurray, located in the heart of the Athabasca oil sands, was hit by a massive system of wildfires that swept through the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo. The first wildfire was discovered on April 30, north of Fort McMurray. The Regional Municipality declared a local state of emergency and a mandatory evacuation order for Centennial Park on May 1 as well as another evacuation order for Prairie Creek and Centennial Trailer Park on May 2. The Fort McMurray fire grew rapidly due to hot and dry weather conditions, doubling in size to 2,656 hectares in a manner of hours. On May 3, the wildfire intensified and crossed over Highway 63, cutting off the route to evacuees, prompting the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation to declare a state of local emergency and a mandatory evacuation order for Fort McMurray?s Lower Townsite and downtown area, which included the communities of Gregoire, Beacon Hill, Abasand, Waterways, Draper, Saline Creek, Grayling Terrace, Thickwood, Wood Buffalo and Dickinsfield. Later in the day the entire city of Fort McMurray was under a mandatory evacuation order. During the evacuations two people were killed in a car crash. On May 4, the Alberta government declared a provincial state of emergency. The Fort McMurray fire quickly grew to 85,000 hectares as the wildfire spread further north and east eventually passing through Fort McMurray. Evacuees that fled north of Fort McMurray had to be air lifted to safety. Some evacuees were taken to Lac La Biche, while the majority where sent to Edmonton and Calgary. On May 10, two of the main Fort McMurray fires joined together and formed a massive blaze of 229,000 hectares. On May 16, all workers in work camps and oil sand operations north of Fort McMurray were forced to move south as the wildfire spread further north. Residents of Fort McMurray were allowed to return home on June 1. In total, the Fort McMurray fires burned approximately 579,767 hectares of land causing the evacuation of over 90,000 people and destroyed 2,400 homes and business, including 530 other buildings that were damaged.

For 2 consecutive years, the BC wildfire seasons were record-breaking. At the end of the season, there was a reported 2,091 fires that burned over 1.35 million hectares of land; more than the previous record. A provincial State of Emergency was declared on August 15th and eventually cancelled on September 7th.\\nIn August during the peak of the fire season, over 10 million Canadians were exposed to exposed to smoke-polluted air ? Calgary had 478 hours of smoke and haze which is almost 40 times their normal amount.\\t\\t\\t3200\\t0.0000\\t\\t9/7/2018 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tWildfire\\tOntario\\t7/3/2018 12:00:00 AM\\t2018 was an exceptionally busy fire season in Ontario with nearly twice as many fires and more than double the burned area than the 10-year average. At the end of the season, there was a reported 1,325 fires that burned over 275,000 ha of land. In July alone, 549 fires were recorded. Over 900 out-of-province personnel were brought in from 9 provinces and territories, the United States and Mexico. \\nSome of the most notable fires were: Nipigon 30 which was the largest fire and burned almost 33,000 ha; and both Parry Sound 33 and the Temagami fire cluster led to multiple evacuation orders of communities, the closure of provincial parks, and air quality advisories.\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0000\\t\\t9/1/2018 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tGrand River, ON\\t2/16/2018 12:00:00 AM\\tThe winter of 2018 was one of the coldest on record, which created a very strong icepack throughout the Grand River watershed in Ontario. In addition to this, temperature drops led to the formation of frazil ice ? heavy slush in rivers. \\nOn February 19th, 40-60 mm of rain fell. The combination of frazil ice, ice jams, 40-60 mm of rain, and 50-70mm of melting snowpack caused the water levels of the Grand River to rise rapidly. Ice jams tended to form in Cambridge, Brantford and Cayuga ? in Cambridge the ice jam measured 5 km upstream.\\nThe Grand River Conservation Authority issued flood warnings for several communities including Brantford, Cambridge, North Dumfries and Brant County. The first warning was issued on February 16th but by February 18th a warning was issued for the entire watershed. \\nUp to 2,200 homes and 4,900 residents were impacted by an evacuation order. In Cambridge, ice and debris damaged city infrastructure, communications and a water main. The City of Brantford declared a State of Emergency. Along the Grand River near Orangeville, a young boy drowned in the floodwaters.\\t1\\t\\t4900\\t0.0000\\t\\t2/21/2018 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tNew Brunswick\\t4/27/2018 12:00:00 AM\\tIn early April, the deep snowpacks in parts of New Brunswick were exposed to over 48 hours of warm temperatures of up to 29C. In addition, a total of 152 mm of rain fell over a period of 31 of 32 days. Widespread flooding in the St. John River basin deeply impacted several communities including its capital of Fredericton. \\nEvery community along the St. John River between Fredericton and St. John experienced high water levels. On April 27th, the water level along the St. John River reached flood stage in Fredericton and Maugerville. By April 30th, the river was above flood stage between Fredericton and St. John. The flood peaked on May 6th from Maugerville to Sheffield-Lakeville Corner, and from the latter to St. John on May 7th reaching record-breaking flood stages for most of these stations.\\nThere were significant disruptions to the transportation network including 150 impacted provincial roads, eroded roadways, weight restrictions on bridges and the closure of parts of the trans-Canada highway between Fredericton and Moncton. According to the Red Cross, as of January 2019, there were 33 individuals still displaced from these floods.\\nAccording to Environment and Climate Change Canada, this flood was the largest and most impactful flood in modern New Brunswick history.\\t\\t\\t1400\\t0.0000\\t\\t5/13/2018 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tHeat Event\\tQuebec\\t6/30/2018 12:00:00 AM\\tRecord-breaking heat was measured across Canada and in parts of southern Ontario and Quebec.

The estimated wind speeds were up to 265 km/hr. \\nAn EF-2 tornado, the second largest tornado of the outbreak, struck the Ottawa neighbourhoods of Arlington Woods and Craig Henry at around 6:00pm. The estimated wind speeds of this tornado was up to 220 km/hr.\\nFour EF-1 tornadoes with wind speeds estimated between 138-177 km/hr touched down near Calabogie, ON; near the Baskatong Reservoir, QC, at around 3:30 pm (on the ground for 10 km); near Val-des-Bois, QC, at around 5:00pm (on the ground for 13 km); and near Otter Lake, QC, (on the ground for 3 km). In Quebec, the tornadoes caused $8.4 million in damages/losses to Hydro-Quebec.\\nExtensive building damage was reported ? almost 1,700 housing units were damaged in Gatineau, and 160 buildings with serious structural damage in the City of Ottawa, in addition to apartment complexes and commercial businesses in both affected areas. The tornado outbreak caused $334 million in insured damage, with at least $192 million in eastern Ontario and $102 million in the Gatineau Region.\\t\\t6\\t\\t334000000.0000\\t\\t9/21/2018 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t334000000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tStorms and Severe Thunderstorms\\tSouthern Alberta\\t8/1/2018 12:00:00 AM\\tA hail storm struck Calgary on July 23rd which created drifts of hail and large hailstones.

In the Beauce region of Quebec, 154.5 mm of rain fell in April and was one of the first regions to be impacted by the spring floods.\\nThe most severe flooding took place in Quebec where there were over 10,000 evacuees and over 6,600 flooded homes. One person was killed in Pontiac, QC, after the road washed out. In Sainte-Marthe-sur-le-Lac, a suburb of Montreal in the Deux-Montagnes MRC, a 15-23 m rupture in the natural dyke system forced the immediate evacuation of over 5,000 residents and 50 streets were flooded overnight on April 27-28th. Historical water levels were also experienced at the Chute-Bell hydro dam along Riviere Rouge where 50 residents of Grenville-sur-la-Rouge were evacuated due to fears of a dam failure.\\nStates of emergency extended across the 3 provinces, including in Ottawa and Montreal. By the end of April, over a dozen states of emergency had been declared along the Ottawa River and its tributaries alone.

The blowout shot oil 45 m into the air and sprayed fields as far as 5 kilometres away; natural gas also leaked. While the well blowout was creating 10,000-15,000 barrels of oil per day, the uncontrollable release spewed 1.4 million barrels and over a billion cubic metres of natural gas into the air and surrounding farmland. Unprecedented efforts were made to plug the blowout - with everything from cement to chicken feathers - as well as the drilling of relief wells but with no avail.  On September 6th, the well caught fire, and with 16 ha of land burning, the fire could be seen from 64 km away. The fire burned for 3 days, but the blowout was not contained until November 9th. As a result of the blowout, the contaminated fields in the surrounding area took decades to return to productive farmland.

The recorded peak flow was 110,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) and 7m (23.1 ft.) above normal river levels. The community power plant closed for a week, and the water supply was temporarily halved, causing over 150 individuals to be evacuated. As a result of this flood, Lethbridge rezoned the residential area in the floodplain to parkland (now Indian Battle Park), and encouraged several residents to relocate outside of the floodplain.\\t0\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t6/10/1953 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tOld Man River, Alberta\\t6/6/1908 12:00:00 AM\\tIn June of 1908, Old Man River in Alberta experienced one of its highest peak flows in history; caused by heavy rains and an already saturated ground because of snowmelt. On June 6th, the peak flow was estimated to be 200,000 cubic feet per second (cfs)\\xa0, and 8 m (26.7 ft.) above normal river levels. Due to the floods of 1902, the river had widened, therefore the flood of 1908 had a higher volume of water but a slightly less height above normal. Regardless, the 1908 flood caused significant losses to several communities such as Lethbridge and McLeod, AB. This included a population dip in Lethbridge, significant damage to critical infrastructure  (e.g. damage to the new CPR bridge, viaduct, powerhouse, and hospital), and the destruction of many homes.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t6/6/1908 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tGeomagnetic Storm\\tAcross Canada\\t8/4/1972 12:00:00 AM\\tOn August 4th, a moderately severe geomagnetic storm caused disruptions in communication and power services throughout Canada and the United States.

The second tornado (F3) touched down at 3:45pm near Cascades, QC, and caused a 60 km path of damage to Pendleton, ON. The last tornado (F2) touched down at 5:10pm near Bernardin, ON, and caused a 14 km path of damage. Although these tornadoes were typical in formation, duration, direction, etc., they did display unique characteristics in rough terrain (e.g., increasing in intensity on the downslope and valleys). The second and largest tornado impacted the community of Masson-Anger, QC, and damaged 50 houses and businesses, injuring 36 individuals.

On the first day of the storm, 25 cm fell, and on the second, a further 53 cm—78.3 cm of snow had fallen by the end of the storm. Since cars and streetcars were buried by the snow, Victoria reverted back to horses: the fire and police departments used horse-drawn sleighs, merchants converted their wagons to sleighs to make deliveries, milkmen strapped cans of milk to horses, and a local blacksmith created a steel snowplough to be pulled by horses. The winter to date had been cold, and the coal supply was already low leaving many families to burn trees in their yards and wooden fences; several families stayed in hotels. Roughly 800-1,000 soldiers training at a nearby base helped shovel snow, in addition to 150 hired labourers. Fifty men even pulled a wooden snowplough to help clear the streets. It took 2 weeks for Victoria to return to normal routines.

By August 27th, 1,079 firefighters were fighting the fire. The fire lasted for over 75 days, burned 26,240 ha (262 km2) including 72 homes and 9 businesses. The losses were estimated to be $31 million (CAD 2005) and $8.2 million in property damage. Additionally, the loss of a sawmill in Louis Creek led to the more than 180 employees permanently losing their jobs. In British Columbia, the insured losses of this fire season were $200 million (2003 CAD).\\t0\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t10/13/2003 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tTransportation accident\\tMarine\\tLake Timiskaming\\t6/11/1978 12:00:00 AM\\tOn June 11th, a group of 27 school children and 4 adult leaders from St. John\\'s Private School were on year end school canoe trip on Lake Timiskaming, ON, when the winds capsized their canoes.

Reports note that the first fire was initiated at around midnight, but was under control by mid-afternoon. The second fire was initiated by lightning near the community of Pelly Crossing, YT, - 4 km northwest of Faro. The community of Faro began as a mining camp and construction had begun on the town site in Fall of 1968. During that night, part of the mining camp, the construction camp and the partly finished community burned down. Pelly Crossing was evacuated, but was not destroyed by the fire. In the end, the burned area measured 73,000 ha (730 km2) causing the destruction of 50 buildings in Faro, costing an estimated $500,000 (1969 CAD).\\t0\\t0\\t\\t\\t\\t7/25/1969 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tTornado\\tAngus, Ontario\\t6/17/2014 12:00:00 AM\\tOn June 17th, an EF2 tornado struck Angus, ON, a community 18 km southwest of Barrie.

After an inspection, it was decided to let the 80 ha fire burn freely. According to the policy at the time, fire crews were not allowed to suppress fires until they were within a certain distance of a road, community or major river. Even though local Metis trappers volunteered to help suppress the fire as it moved towards and into Alberta, fire crews were ordered not to go. A second fire began on July 29th, and eventually joined the Whisp fire between September 20 and 22nd. By this time, there were over 30 fires greater than 200 ha burning along the northern borders of BC and Alberta; the newly-merged Chinchaga fire spread 63 km. The smoke plume drifted from northern Alberta to southern Ontario which caused high mid-day electricity demand to turn on the lights and subsequently led to several power outages. The Whisp/Chinchaga fires burned 1.4 million ha (14,000 km2) and was recorded as the largest wildfire in North American history. The majority of the burned area was in Alberta; only 90,000 ha were in BC.\\t0\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t10/4/1950 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tFire\\tNon-Residential\\tWinnipeg, Manitoba\\t6/8/1954 12:00:00 AM\\tOn June 8th, at 1:18am (local), the Winnipeg fire department responded to a call of a small fire behind a neon sign at the Time Building—a 7-storey building near Portage Avenue and Hargrave Street. Due to strong winds, the fire spread, and by 5:53am, it had jumped Hargrave Street and burned the Dismorr Block and onto The Henry Building. All firetrucks in the department (except 2) were dispatched to the large fire, which was eventually contained by the end of the morning. In the end, the fire destroyed over 100 businesses and caused an estimated $2-$3 million (1954 CAD) in losses in addition to almost $35,000 in municipal costs (demolition, fire equipment). This event is considered to be one of the worst fires in Winnipeg\\'s history.\\t0\\t0\\t\\t\\t\\t6/8/1954 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tTransportation accident\\tAir\\tOff coast of Newfoundland\\t3/12/2009 12:00:00 AM\\tOn March 12th at 9:55am (local), a Cougar Helicopter (Cougar 91) crashed off the coast of Newfoundland while on route to the Hibernia oil platform.

It was an ideal fire season for the area; the winter of 1919 had a low snowfall, followed by an early spring drought, and hot and dry conditions in May. Within hours, the entire community had burned  down, except for the local inn, church, train station and a few other buildings. Property damage and inventory losses were estimated to be over $200,000 (1919 CAD). This fire, however, was part of a larger complex that stretched to Prince Albert, SK, and Meadow Lake, SK (over 300 km east). In total, the fire burned over 2 million ha (20,000 km2) of forest. Indigenous lands and people were also deeply affected by this fire. For example, the fire reached a small Cree hunting party on Sekip Lake, SK, resulting in the death of 11 individuals, and the injury of 12 others.\\t11\\t12\\t\\t\\t\\t5/28/1919 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tBiological\\tEpidemic\\tAlberta\\t5/20/2003 12:00:00 AM\\tOn May 20th, it was announced that a single breeder cow in northern Alberta tested positive for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).

This earthquake was felt as far as Portland, Oregon, Prince Rupert, BC, and in the Rocky Mountains. Nearby communities such as Courtenay, Campbell River, Cumberland and Union Bay experienced considerable damage; 75% of chimneys were thrown down in some communities.  Chimney damage was noted as far as Victoria. A chimney collapse at an elementary school in Courtenay fell into the building, through the roof and onto the desks of a classroom below - luckily the earthquake occurred outside of school hours. The earthquake also caused soil failure, landslides and a landslide-generated displacement wave (tsunami). The tsunami affected parts of the Georgia Strait and nearby inlets; the maximum wave height was 2 m. Of the 2 deaths reported, one was a heart attack in Seattle, the other was a drowning when a boat capsized in the displacement wave near Mapleguard Point.\\t2\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t6/23/1946 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tFire\\tNon-Residential\\tWhitehorse, Yukon\\t5/23/1905 12:00:00 AM\\tOn the morning of May 23rd, a fire broke out in the barber shop of the Windsor Hotel in Whitehorse, YT.

It is estimated that between 52 and 232 lives were lost, mostly from the island of St. Pierre just south of Newfoundland. However, 13 lives were lost on Lake Erie when 2 steamships sank.\\t54\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t9/13/1900 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tTransportation accident\\tMarine\\tOff Cappahayden, Newfoundland\\t2/24/1918 12:00:00 AM\\tThe \"SS Florizel\" was a Red Cross Line passenger ship that was scheduled to depart St. John\\'s, NL, to New York on February 22nd. A winter storm delayed its departure. However, the director of the Bowring Company - in which the company also owned the Red Cross Line - was a passenger and may have influenced Captain Martin\\'s decision to set sail during the storm. The Florizel was carrying 60 crew and 78 passengers including John Shannon Munn (the Bowring Company director) and his young daughter. With limited visibility, the Florizel prematurely adjusted its course and at 4:44am (local) on February 24th struck the rocks near Cappahayden, NL. There were several rescue attempts, but the storm continued for another day. At dawn on February 25th, 40 were rescued including Captain Martin. Ninety-four passengers and crew perished including Mr. Munn and his daughter.\\t94\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t2/24/1918 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tTransportation accident\\tMarine\\tLake Superior\\t11/21/1902 12:00:00 AM\\tThe 75 m (245 ft) canal steamer the \"Bannockburn\" was last seen on November 21st leaving Port Arthur, ON, (now Thunder Bay). The Bannockburn was carrying 85,000 bushels of wheat and heading south to Midland, ON, on Lake Superior. Strong winds hampered travel on Lake Superior and the Bannockburn was listed as overdue for several days. However, after 6 days the Bannockburn never reached the Sault locks and was listed as missing. Only a tied life-jacket was found from the wreckage which washed up 15 months later. All 21 crew members perished.\\t21\\t0\\t\\t\\t\\t11/21/1902 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tTransportation accident\\tMarine\\tNewfoundland Ridge\\t4/14/1912 12:00:00 AM\\tTitanic is one of the most famous marine disasters of all time. Although the wreckage lies in international waters along the Newfoundland Ridge (off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland), this disaster did impact Canadians and Canada. At 11:40pm on the night of April 14th, Titanic struck and iceberg, breaching 6 of its 16 watertight compartments. Only 2 hours and 40 minutes after striking the iceberg, Titanic sank at 2:20am in the early morning of the 15th.  There were roughly 2,222 passengers and crew on board; only 705 survived. Of the 34 Canadians on board, 20 of them perished. Among the dead included Harry Molson, the inheritor of the Molson Brewing company, and Charles Melville Hays, the president of the Grand Trunk Railway and governor of McGill University. On Wednesday April 17th, the Cable Steamer Mackay-Bennett was dispatched from Halifax in the recovery effort. After arriving at the wreckage site on April 20th, the crew spent 5 days recovering over 300 bodies. On April 26th, the Minia, another cable ship from Halifax, relieved the former and continued operations. After 8 days, a further 17 bodies were recovered.  Two more Canadian ships, the CGS Montmagny and the SS Algerine would continue the efforts and recover 5 more bodies. A temporary morgue was established at the Mayflower Curling Rink in Halifax. In total, 119 individuals were buried at sea, the remains of 59 were claimed and privately buried by relatives, and 150 bodies were buried in three cemeteries in Halifax: Fairview Lawn, Mount Olivet and Baron de Hirsch.\\t20\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t4/15/1912 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\n'"

The floods resulted from heavy precipitation in the mountains, foothills and Great Plains regions, compounded by high antecedent soil moisture conditions.  Crops were destroyed and farm buildings were damaged.  Hundreds of homes were flooded and severe erosion occurred in some communities causing road and bridge damage and several washouts.  The extensive flooding also caused an overflow in several municipal sewer systems leading to sewer collapse. The event resulted in one death.

The explosion killed one Sunrise employee as well as a 25-year veteran of the Toronto Fire Service who died from heart attacked while fighting the fire.\\t2\\t58\\t12000\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t8/10/2008 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tHazardous Chemicals\\tFire\\tZama City AB\\t8/15/2008 12:00:00 AM\\tZama City AB, August 15, 2008. A block of sulphur accidently caught fire when crewmembers were working to dispose of the leftover sulphur from the Aphache Gas Plant near Zama City.  The fire started in the front-end loader, which the crew was using to remove the sulphur. The fire ignited the sulphur payload emitting deadly hydrogen-sulphide gas. Mackenzie County officials declared a state of emergency and ordered an evacuation of the Zama City area, where approximately 250 residents were temporarily evacuated. Three workers were taken to the hospital as a precaution. The evacuation order was lifted after the fire was contained later that day.\\t0\\t3\\t250\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t8/15/2008 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tHurricane / Typhoon / Tropical Storm\\tSaint John NB\\t9/7/2008 12:00:00 AM\\tSaint John NB, September 7, 2008.

The Khyex River Landslide occurred on November 28, between 00:20 and 00:30 PST. This is when Pacific Northern Gas Ltd noticed a pressure loss in the pipeline. Approximately 300 metres of 8-inch pipeline was lost. As a result, most of Prince Rupert residents were without natural gas or heat for 10 days. A few days after the landslide occurred, a temporary 2-inch gas line was installed to restore partial service. The spectacular landslide flowed downstream, crossed the river and flowed upstream for hundreds of metres. This type of landslide took place in very sensitive glaciomarine muds, and is called a retrogressive earthflow. The estimated volume of material displaced by the landslide is up to 4.7 million cubic metres. It is thought that the slope failure was triggered by erosion of the riverbank.\\t0\\t0\\t0\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t11/28/2003 12:00:00 AM\\t0.0000\\t0.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tBiological\\tEpidemic\\tAcross Canada, largely in the Greater Toronto area\\t3/13/2003 12:00:00 AM\\tAcross Canada, 13 March to August, 2003.

A super cell storm developed just south of Lake Huron and tracked northeastward for a remarkable 200 kilometres. The heat and humidity in Ontario increased once the clouds disappeared. A squall line developed over Lower Michigan and traveled across the Great Lakes reaching southern Ontario at 15:00 EDT. This system produced powerful winds from Windsor to northeast of Toronto as well as destructive tornadoes in Vaughan and Newmarket. While these tornadoes were wreaking havoc just north of Toronto, another series of super cell thunderstorms spawned tornadoes in parts of Simcoe County, Muskoka and Parry Sound Districts to the east of Georgian Bay and north towards Lake Nipissing. In total, the day?s weather produced 19 confirmed tornadoes, including: four F0, eleven F1, and four F2. This was the greatest number of F2 tornadoes in Ontario in one day since the Barrie/central Ontario tornadoes of May 31, 1985. It was also a new Canadian record for the most confirmed tornadoes in one day. Violent winds snapped trees, lifted roofs, flattened cars, mowed down fences, collapsed farm buildings, and inflicted property losses around $100 million. The first tornado of the day touched down in the town of Durham in Grey County, killing a young boy as he left a nearby conservation area day camp. About 600 homes, mostly in the communities of Maple and Woodbridge were damaged. Fourty were destroyed and declared unsafe. At the peak of the storm, Hydro One reported that 69,000 customers (approximately 207,000 individuals) had lost power.\\t1\\t0\\t0\\t96183000.0000\\t5044562.9\\t8/20/2009 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t96183000.0000\\t\\t207000\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tStorms and Severe Thunderstorms\\tSouthern Alberta\\t8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM\\tSouthern Alberta, August 1-3, 2009. A cold front swept through southern Alberta on August 1, bringing with it strong wind gusts of up to 100 km/h. The powerful winds brought down a stage at the Big Valley Jamboree in Camrose killing one individual and injuring 75 others. Calgary received wind gusts of up to 78 km/h. The strong winds killed a small child and injured two others when debris from a construction site struck the individuals. On August 2 and 3, a powerful storm developed increasing the severity of the strong winds with wind gusts of up to 107 km/h, along with large hail and heavy rain. The power winds downed trees and power lines, knocking out power to an unknown number of people. In some parts of Alberta, hail was measured at 10 cm deep, with some hail the size of baseballs. Hail caused extensive damages to homes and vehicles.\\t2\\t77\\t0\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t8/3/2009 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t10000\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tNotre-Dame-des-Prairies QC\\t6/28/2009 12:00:00 AM\\tNotre-Dame-des-Prairies QC, June 28 to July 4, 2009. A quasi-stationary low-pressure system stalled over eastern Ontario and Quebec. Excessive rains of up to 140 mm damaged roads and bridges, and flooded basements.  The hardest hit areas were in Charlevoix, Mauricie and Parent. Flood waters filled 50 houses in Notre-Dame-des-Prairies on July 1, and collapsed a street in Entrelacs when a stream overflowed. The flow rate on several rivers exceeded historic records.\\t0\\t0\\t0\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t7/4/2009 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tStorms and Severe Thunderstorms\\tHamilton and Toronto ON\\t7/26/2009 12:00:00 AM\\tHamilton and Toronto ON, July 26, 2009. A storm cell stalled over the western end of Lake Ontario. Hamilton was hard hit. Waves of thunderstorms pounded the city, leaving citizens with flooded basements and motorists stuck in traffic caused by road closures. The midday downpour turned Red Hill Creek into an angry brown torrent that forced the closure of nearby roads and highways. Water gushed into 7000 basements and power was shut off to thousands of customers. While the Hamilton Airport observed only 28 mm of rain, radar estimates confirmed rainfall amounts in an unofficial gauge totaling 110 mm in two hours - worse than a 100-year storm and one of the most intense short-duration rainfalls on record in Canada. Conditions were made worse because the ground was super-saturated from storms two days earlier. In Toronto, parts of Lakeshore Boulevard near the Exhibition grounds were submerged. To the north, a pair of giant sinkholes swallowed part of Finch Avenue West - big enough to hold a fleet of cars and deep enough to cover a four-storey building.\\t0\\t0\\t0\\t173312000.0000\\t9089790.2\\t7/26/2009 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t173312000.0000\\t\\t0\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tStorm - Unspecified / Other\\tMontreal, Alma, La Tuque and Baie-Saint-Paul QC\\t5/14/2009 12:00:00 AM\\tMontreal, Alma, La Tuque and Baie-Saint-Paul QC, May 14, 2009. Winds gusting up to 100 km/h wreaked havoc across Quebec on May 14. An 18-wheeler was one of six tractor-trailers pushed over on its side near Beloeil. Strong winds cut electricity to 70,000 people by downing hydro lines.  Winds also inflicted significant property damage: in Ste-Julie, winds uprooted hundreds of trees and tossed a gazebo and trampoline into the air where there were left dangling from power lines; in Alma, fallen trees crossed power lines, igniting a brush fire; in the La Tuque region, winds blew shingles off a hotel roof and dropped a street light on a home; and in Baie-Saint-Paul, winds snapped hydro poles in half and tore away roofs.\\t0\\t0\\t0\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t5/14/2009 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t70000\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tSaint John, Miramichi and Restigouche River NB\\t4/5/2009 12:00:00 AM\\tSaint John, Miramichi and Restigouche River NB, April 5 to May 4, 2009. A freshet in spring 2009 caused flooding in a number of communities, primarily from the formation of ice jams which raised water levels along the Saint John, Miramichi, and Restigouche rivers from April 5 to May 4.  The flooding caused damages to homes, businesses and infrastructure such as roadways.  Preliminary eligible costs are estimated at $2.0 million, which would result in a federal share of approximately $626,000.\\t0\\t0\\t0\\t2000000.0000\\t104895.1\\t5/4/2009 12:00:00 AM\\t626000.0000\\t1374000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tGeological\\tEarthquake\\tVal-des-Bois and Gracefield QC\\t6/23/2010 12:00:00 AM\\tVal-des-Bois and Gracefield QC, June 23, 2010. At 13:41 EDT, a magnitude 5.0 earthquake occurred near Val-des-Bois. The effects of the earthquake were mostly felt in Ontario and Quebec, although some tremors were felt in the United States as far as Kentucky. The earthquake caused the strongest shaking experienced in Ottawa for over 200 years. The depth of the earthquake was 22 kilometres and it lasted about 20 to 30 seconds. The earthquake caused significant damages to roads in Quebec, including a collapsed bridge on highway 307 near Bowman and the closure of a bridge on highway 105 in Gracefield. There were also two landslides in Quebec caused by the earthquake as well as damages to commercial and residential property. Approximately 300 households near the epicentre lost power for about an hour. A state of emergency was called in Gracefield, but was lifted on June 26.\\t0\\t0\\t0\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t6/23/2010 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t900\\t5.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tTornado\\tD?l?age and Mont-Laurier QC\\t8/4/2009 12:00:00 AM\\tD?l?age and Mont-Laurier QC, August 4, 2009. A powerful F2 tornado touched down in D?l?age at 14:00 EST and track 40 kilometres through Aumond, to Mont-Laurier in the upper Laurentians. The tornado blew away roofs, knocked down walls, flipped over cars, snapped utility poles and downed power lines leaving 4000 residents (12,000 individuals) without power. In Mont-Laurier, 40 homes were damaged, amoung those 28 were rendered uninhabitable. There were no fatalities, although two people were injured and taken to the hospital. The tornado caused about $6 million in insured losses. The tornado\\'s path through Mont-Laurier was 300 metres wide, but its 40 kilometre track was an unusually long distance for a tornado in Quebec and a strong indication of the storm\\'s severity. Previous to this event, the last time a stronger tornado touched down in the Quebec was on the same day in 1994 when an F3 tornado destroyed more than 400 homes in Aylmer.\\t0\\t0\\t0\\t6000000.0000\\t314685.3\\t8/4/2009 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t6000000.0000\\t\\t12000\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tStorms and Severe Thunderstorms\\tWinnipeg and Steinbach MB\\t8/14/2009 12:00:00 AM\\tWinnipeg and Steinbach MB, August 14, 2009. Powerful thunderstorms, spectacular lightning strikes and baseball-sized hail hammered a wide area of southern Manitoba from Winnipeg to Steinbach. More than 7000 instances of damage to houses and vehicles were reported and losses ranged between $50-75 million.

A wildfire 13 kilometres east of Cranberry Portage prompted mandatory and voluntary evacuation orders. Residents from Cranberry Portage were advised to evacuate on June 23 due to smoke from the approaching flames. The Iskwasum and Gyles campgrounds in the Grass River Provincial Park were under a mandatory evacuation order. The road between Cranberry Portage and Sherridon was temporary closed to local traffic due to concerns over visibility. On June 24, approximately 200 people voluntarily evacuated from Cranberry Portage as the fire grew in size. The wildfire reached a maximum size of approximately 55,000 hectares and there were 440 firefighters, 13 helicopters and 13 water bombers combating the flames. On July 6, the travel restrictions near Cranberry Portage were lifted.\\t0\\t0\\t200\\t9572104.0000\\t492983.9\\t7/6/2010 12:00:00 AM\\t9572104.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tHurricane / Typhoon / Tropical Storm\\tHalifax NS\\t8/23/2009 12:00:00 AM\\tHalifax NS, August 23, 2009.

Due to little precipitation and lightning strikes, from July 28 to July 31, the number of fires in British Columbia went from 600 to 1,100.  On August 18, strong winds blew through the interior causing substantial growth of the fires. Throughout the wildfire season, approximately 461 homes (1,383 individuals) were ordered to evacuate the region and hundreds of other homes were put on evacuation alert. The hardest hit areas were Chilcotin, Houston, Williams?Lake, Burns?Lake and Fraser?Lake. All evacuation orders and alerts were removed by the first week of September.  Approximately 330,000 hectares burned due to 1,673 fires.  Over 1,400 personnel from out-of-province assisted with fighting the fires.  Two air tanker pilots died in a plane crash while fighting the fires.  Both the city of Vancouver and the Government of Alberta issued air quality warnings due to smoke caused by the fires.\\t2\\t0\\t1383\\t257339000.0000\\t13253510.7\\t9/8/2010 12:00:00 AM\\t37339000.0000\\t\\t220000000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tGeological\\tEarthquake\\tPort-au-Prince, Haiti\\t1/12/2010 12:00:00 AM\\tPort-au-Prince, Haiti, January 12, 2010.

Overland flooding caused by a combination of snowmelt, seasonal precipitation and the spring breakup affected southern Manitoba\\'s watershed areas of the Red, Pembina, Assiniboine, and Souris Rivers. The event caused flooding of houses and evacuations from communities including Roseau River First Nation, Sioux Falls, Peguis First Nation, St. Andrews, St. Clements and Selkirk. The flooding also resulted in damage to public infrastructure such as bridges, roads, and highways. Three principal factors led to the spring flooding: 1) Heavy autumn rains, about 43 per cent more than normal, saturated the ground just before freezing in early December, which left little room for absorbing snow melt in the spring; 2) It was a snowy winter in southern Manitoba with some 25 per cent more snowfall than normal. Heavy snowfalls and copious spring rains swelled the critical headwaters of North Dakota sending excessive waters north into Canada via the Red River and its tributaries; and, 3) An unseasonably cold spring slowed basin snow melting, ice decaying in rivers, and overland flow from ditches and culverts.\\t0\\t0\\t3000\\t76506000.0000\\t4012552.4\\t5/21/2009 12:00:00 AM\\t70006000.0000\\t6500000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tDrought\\tSaskatchewan and Alberta\\t3/1/2009 12:00:00 AM\\tSaskatchewan and Alberta, March 1 to July 1, 2009.

For example, Saskatoon had less than one-quarter of the usual amount of spring precipitation, making the months of March, April and May the driest since record-keeping began in 1892. It wasn\\'t just spring that was dry. The soil moisture recharge period between September 1, 2008 and March 31, 2009 had less than 60 per cent of normal precipitation. To the west, in Alberta, conditions were even drier, as illustrated by precipitation amounts in Edmonton, where the 12- month total rain and snow from July 2008 to June 2009 was only 234 mm, less than half of normal and the driest such period with records dating back to 1880. Making matters worse, eight of the last ten years in Alberta\\'s capital of Edmonton had less rain and snow than the 30-year average total, but no year was as scanty as the most recent. Not surprisingly, the flow of the North Saskatchewan River was at its third lowest level in nearly a century.\\t0\\t0\\t0\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tGeological\\tLandslide\\tEcho Harbour BC\\t9/30/1922 12:00:00 AM\\tEcho Harbour BC, September 30, 1922. 5 dead; debris avalanche caused by heavy rains destroyed a logging camp.\\t5\\t0\\t0\\t\\t\\t9/30/1922 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tExplosion\\tNon-Residential\\tComox BC\\t1/1/1923 12:00:00 AM\\tComox BC, 1923.

A winter storm with high winds, low visibility and icy conditions made navigation and maneuvering difficult. At 4:09am (local), the Wilkes ran aground, followed by the Truxtun at 4:10am, and the Pollux at 4:17am. The USS Wilkes managed to free itself, however, the USS Truxton and USS Pollux began to break-up in the waves. Luckily both ships remained relatively upright, and many men were able to hold on until dawn. At 8:00am (local), upon hearing about the wreck, the nearby Iron Springs Mine shut down operations and directed all resources to the rescue effort. As the day continued more Newfoundlanders joined the rescue efforts and just after midnight on the 19th, the last survivor was rescued. Combined, the USS Truxton and USS Pollux carried 389 men; 203 perished from drowning or succumbed to the elements.\\t203\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t2/19/1942 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tHurricane / Typhoon / Tropical Storm\\tCharlottetown PE\\t9/22/1942 12:00:00 AM\\tCharlottetown PE, September 22, 1942.

In the Outer Battery, another avalanche (caused by the same storm) buried a house that withheld the weight of the snow.  The strong structure protected the residents; however, they were trapped until dug out by rescue workers.  This was the second avalanche to affect The Battery in 40 years.  Inspection of the slopes has shown that a rockfall risk exists, and that The Battery is frequently affected by rockfalls.

The accompanying wind caused hydro blackouts throughout Greater Vancouver, the Fraser Valley and along the Sunshine Coast. Blocked culverts and plugged storm drains caused extensive damage to surrounding areas. The following creeks reported the majority of the flooding: Lynn Creek, Seymour Creek and Mosquito Creek. Areas which received the most damage were: District of North Vancouver, City of North Vancouver, Pemberton, Squamish and Howe Sound. First Nation reserves also reported damage.

As a result, the remote settlement of Aklavik experienced significant flooding. Flood waters damaged numerious homes in Aklavik and left debris scattered along the settlement\\'s airstrip. On June 3, flood water reached a peak level of nearly 11 metres. It is estimated that 95 per cent of the Mackenzie Delta was under water.

Leading up to the January 18th event, temperatures were in the -12 to -35 degrees Celsius range.  On the 18th, temperatures decreased further to the -30 to -40 degrees Celsius range.  Winds from the west were 65 km/hr with wind gusts up to 111 km/hr occurring during the evening hours.  This resulted in wind chills of -53 to -58 degrees Celsius.  Heavy snowfall and high winds reduced visibility to near zero, and were the cause of a power outage at the Harrie Lake Trailer Court.  The outage left residents without heat or hydro, and the extreme cold caused water pipes to freeze and burst within a majority of the residences.  The Mayor declared a local state of emergency, loaders and dump trucks were brought in to create access routes, and 2,000 residents of the trailer park were evacuated to A.P.

Hurricane Irene, the storm that caused over 40 deaths and billions of dollars in damages in the United States, moved north into Canada affecting parts of Quebec and the Maritime provinces. The 400 kilometre-wide Post-Tropical storm produced heavy rain and strong gusts of wind, which downed trees and power lines. Parts of Quebec received more than 100 mm of rain and wind gusts of up to 113 km/h. On August 28, Hydro-Quebec reported approximately 250,000 customers (750,000 individuals) without power and by August 29, only 80,000 households were without power. The storm was responsible for two deaths in Quebec; one man died while attempting to reach his family in the storm, while another went missing and is presumed dead when his car was washed down river. Approximately 350 residents were evacuated in Quebec. Strong winds produced six-metre waves over western Maritime waters. Some parts of Labrador received up to 40 mm of rain overnight, while Doaktown and Fredricton New Brunswick received 89 mm and 53 mm respectively. Approximately 50,000 households (150,000 individuals) in New Brunswick and 8000 (24,000 individuals) households in Nova Scotia were without power during the height of the storm.\\t2\\t\\t350\\t153856000.0000\\t7699216.0\\t8/30/2011 12:00:00 AM\\t16056000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t137800000.0000\\t\\t1169000\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tPerth-Andover NB\\t3/23/2012 12:00:00 AM\\tPerth-Andover NB, March 23-25, 2012. The Village of Perth-Andover declared a state of emergency on March 23. The village of roughly 1,770 residents was forced to evacuate approximately 500 people living along a four-kilometre section the St. John?s River on March 24. Within the nearby Tobique First Nation community, approximately 20 people were evacuated to a school gymnasium and six homes were damaged by floodwaters. Public Safety Canada?s regional office reported that approximately 200 homes and businesses were damaged, including those of the Tobique First Nation. The province?s Emergency Measures Organization indicated that unseasonably hot weather caused rapid snowmelt, resulting in an ice jam that was to blame for the river breaching its banks. Andover Elementary School and Southern Victoria High School were both closed due to damages from the floodwaters. The Red Cross used Perth-Andover Middle School as an emergency evacuation site. Perth-Andover hospital also sustained damages; patients were relocated to the Upper River Valley Hospital in Waterville and Grand Falls General Hospital, while some were discharged home. Service New Brunswick?s temporary location in Perth-Andover offered free well-water bacterial testing for private well owners who were impacted by the flood. Health Canada was responsible for contacting well owners with information on potentially harmful contamination in their water, whereas Environment Canada as well as local authorities were responsible for notifying remaining well owners of the absence of bacteria in their water. New Brunswick?s provincial government offered information on government services for people whose property sustained damage resulting from the flood. The response level remained within provincial capacity.\\t\\t\\t500\\t19778000.0000\\t975086.3\\t3/25/2012 12:00:00 AM\\t19778000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tFort Albany and Kashechewan First Nations ON\\t3/24/2012 12:00:00 AM\\tKashechewan and Fort Albany ON, March 24 to April 01, 2012. On Saturday, March 24, 2012, a state of emergency was declared by both Fort Albany First Nations and Kashechewan First Nations.  Due to warmer temperatures, early ice break up on the Albany River caused waterways to jam and the water level to rise in low-lying communities.  Evacuations of both communities commenced with 54 of the most vulnerable residents who were flown to the Town of Kapuskasing on March 24, and continued until a total of 269 people had been evacuated to both the Towns of Kapuskasing and Wawa by March 25.  On March 31, 2012, colder temperatures and observations of ice movement resulted in the Chief and Band Council terminating the declared emergency.  All 269 evacuees were repatriated by April 1, 2012.  Emergency Management Ontario and the federal Ministry of Natural Resources co-ordinated the evacuation with the help of federal, municipal and First Nations officials.  Although emergency management is a provincial/territorial responsibility, Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (AANDC) accepts responsibility for supporting emergency management in First Nations communities and manages the consequences arising from the emergency such as disruptions to community-level critical services delivered in the First Nation.\\t\\t\\t269\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tTornado\\tSouthern Ontario\\t8/19/2005 12:00:00 AM\\tSouthern Ontario ON, August 19, 2005.

As many as 11 wildfires burned out of control in Mackenzie County in northwestern Alberta, leading to two community evacuations.  All Zama residents, including work camps were evacuated under a mandatory evacuation order on Tuesday, July 10 until July 20.  The Zama access road was closed and a controlled barricade was set up at the Assumption Bypass/Apache Road into Zama to ensure that only authorized personnel were allowed access.  A reception centre for evacuees was set up in the town hall of High Level. There were approximately 300 evacuees, including 134 from Zama and 164 from the Dene Tha? First Nation. The evacuation order was lifted July 17. Firefighters from Yukon, New Brunswick, Ontario, Alaska, and Mexico, along with helicopters and other equipment, joined over 300 firefighters already taking shifts to battle the fires in northern Alberta. Alberta?s Environment and Sustainable Resource Development (ESRD) provided sprinkling protection systems for all north end homes with additional sprinkling systems having been ordered to protect the homes located in the Zama interior.  A sprinkling system for the fireguard along the containment line was also provided by ESRD.  On July 17, Alberta Health Services issued an air quality advisory for residents in the La Crete area with respiratory concerns, advising them to visit the advanced ambulatory care centre located in the La Crete Community Health Centre. The advisory was lifted July 23.\\t0\\t0\\t300\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t7/20/2012 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tGeomagnetic Storm\\tProvince of Quebec\\t3/13/1989 12:00:00 AM\\tProvince of Quebec, March 13, 1989.

Earthquake ? A magnitude 9.0-9.1 earthquake struck off the coast of Honshu, Japan on March 11 at 14:46 local time. The earthquake had a depth of 24 kilometres and struck 129 kilometres outside the city of Sendai, 177 kilometres outside of Fukushima and some 372 kilometres northeast of Tokyo. Tsunami ? The earthquake triggered a massive tsunami with waves reaching as high as 40 metres and struck land as far as 10 kilometres inland. Close to 28,000 people were reported dead or missing as a result of the earthquake and tsunami. Japanese authorities estimated the number of people injured as a result of this disaster was over 4000.  Over 220,000 buildings were damaged or destroyed.  Costs of damages resulting from the earthquake and tsunami have been estimated at over $300 billion. Nuclear Emergency ? The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was severely damaged by the initial earthquake and subsequent tsunami that followed. A nuclear emergency was declared by Japanese authorities following problems with one of the cooling systems. These problems resulted in three major explosions at the Fukushima nuclear power plant resulting in a level 7 nuclear meltdown. The explosions took place at reactor 1 on March 12, reactor 3 on March 14, and reactor 2 on March 15. On March 14, Japanese Prime Minister Kan announced that the 20 kilometre evacuation zone had been expanded to include a warning for people within 30 kilometres of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The Canadian federal department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) provided potassium Iodide (KI) to staff at the Canadian mission in Tokyo and Health Canada monitored gamma-radiation levels at the Embassy, confirming the absence of significant radiation meaning there was little threat to the health of Embassy staff. The Canadian government?s support to the government of Japan included a disaster victim identification team, chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear technical expertise and equipment, Canadian Armed Forces military assets to facilitate humanitarian relief efforts, relief stocks, and emergency medical and engineering capabilities. At the time of the earthquake, there were an estimated 11,000 Canadian citizens present in Japan. One Canadian citizen was confirmed to have been killed as a result of the earthquake and tsunami. Total cost estimated is over $300 billion.\\t1\\t\\t\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t3/11/2011 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t9.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tWildfire\\tSheshatshiu NL\\t6/23/2012 12:00:00 AM\\tNorth West River and Sheshatshiu NL, June 23-25, 2012.

A massive storm system crept through Alberta causing significant flooding throughout the province. As of 2013, this event was responsible for the largest evacuation due to a natural disaster in Alberta?s history. Beginning in northern Alberta, Fort McMurray declared a local state of emergency when water from the Hanging Stone River breached its banks on June 8. The storm then moved south on June 19, where it remained for three days over southern Alberta. Heavy rain spanning across a region from Canmore to Calgary produced an average of 75 to 150 mm during this three-day period. Twenty-nine local states of emergency were declared throughout the province. Four deaths were attributed to the floods, which caused significant disruptions across the province to power, telecommunications, clean water supply, and transportation corridors, including a section of the Trans-Canada Highway that closed due to a mudslide caused by the torrential rain. In Calgary the Bow and Elbow Rivers flooded, which forced 75,000 residents to evacuate the city. Over 4000 business were affected and 3000 buildings were flooded, including that Saddledome and the Calgary Zoo. The towns of High River and Canmore were also significantly impacted by the floods. In total, flooding forced the evacuations of approximately 100,000 Albertans. As flood conditions improved, some residents were allowed to gradually return to their communities beginning on June 23, while the remaining residents were allowed to return by June 28. Response to the flood was provided by municipal, provincial, and federal governments and non-governmental organizations. Insurance payments are estimated at $1.2 billion. This disaster is estimated to have reduced Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Southern Alberta by $550 million (2013 dollars).\\t4\\t0\\t100000\\t2715742000.0000\\t132690977.2\\t6/28/2013 12:00:00 AM\\t1015742000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t1700000000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tWildfire\\tTimmins ON\\t5/24/2012 12:00:00 AM\\tTimmins ON, May 24 to June 07, 2012.

A significant heat wave across British Columbia in July and August led to record breaking dry conditions and ?high? to ?extreme? fire danger ratings in most of the province. Almost 360,000 hectares of land was burned ?the third highest in the history of the province. Over 4,500 people were forced to evacuate throughout the season with the largest evacuations taking place in West Kelowna where 2,500 people fled and Hudson?s Hope where 1,150 people fled in July due to wildfires. At its peak, over 3000 firefighters and frontline crews worked at combating the fires, and as a result, significant damage to infrastructure and communities was avoided. As of November 2014, the Government of British Columbia estimated it spent approximately $300 million dollars responding to wildfires for the 2014 season.\\t0\\t0\\t4500\\t300000000.0000\\t14376996.8\\t9/30/2014 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t300000000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tWildfire\\tNorthwest Territories\\t6/1/2014 12:00:00 AM\\tNorthwest Territories, July 1 to September 18, 2014. Abnormally dry conditions and high temperatures fed peak wildfire conditions during the 2014 fire season. By mid-July, 168 separate fires were burning throughout the territory. Voluntary and mandatory evacuations were issued in June and July, most notably in the town of Kakisa where 60 residents were evacuated to Hay River and Fort Providence. The Taltson hydroelectric facility was temporarily shut down as a precautionary measure due to fires that threatened the main transmission lines. By the end of the wildfire season, over 3.5 million hectares of land was burned, the most in over 30 years. In total, 385 fires burned throughout the territory in 2014, 57 per cent more than the annual average. The Government of the Northwest Territories spent $55 million dollars fighting wildfires in 2014, more than eight times the average cost.\\t0\\t0\\t60\\t55000000.0000\\t2635782.7\\t9/18/2014 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t55000000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tStorms and Severe Thunderstorms\\tSoutheast British Columbia\\t6/19/2013 12:00:00 AM\\tSoutheast British Columbia, June 19-21, 2013. A series of intense rainstorms impacted southwestern Alberta and tracked into southeastern British Columbia, causing widespread flooding, mudslides and road closures. Up to 130 mm of rain fell in some regions and multiple evacuations were ordered. There were 130 homes that were evacuated in Sparwood due to rising flood waters while two mudslides closed parts of Highway 31. Highways 1, 31, 31A, 43 and 93 were all closed due to washouts and debris flow. There also was extensive overland flooding in the town of Fernie.\\t0\\t0\\t200\\t10796000.0000\\t527491.9\\t6/21/2013 12:00:00 AM\\t10796000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tTransportation accident\\tRail\\tBurlington ON\\t2/26/2012 12:00:00 AM\\tBurlington ON, February 26-27, 2012. VIA Rail passenger train No. 92 was travelling from Niagara Falls to Toronto. At 15:23 EDT, the train was approaching Burlington while entering crossover track No. 5 at 67 mph, which was 4.5 times the authorized speed limit. Subsequently, the locomotive and all five cars carrying 70 passengers derailed. Three crewmembers were fatally injured and 45 people sustained various injuries. The locomotive fuel tank was punctured and approximately 4,300 litres of diesel fuel was released into the environment. Site remediation work was contracted locally and monitoring wells were installed to monitor any potential ground water contamination.\\t3\\t45\\t0\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t2/27/2012 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tInfrastructure failure\\tManufacturing / Industry\\tQuesnel Lake BC\\t8/4/2014 12:00:00 AM\\tQuesnel Lake BC, August 4-12, 2014. The dam for the tailings pond at the Imperial Metals Mount Polley copper and gold mine breached; releasing nearly 10 million cubic metres of water and 4.5 million cubic metres of contaminated slurry into nearby Polley Lake, Hazeltine Creek, Cariboo Creek and Quesnel Lake. On August 6, the Cariboo Regional District declared a local state of emergency in several nearby communities due to concerns over the quality of drinking water, affecting over 300 residents. By August 12, the BC Government lifted the ban on drinking water for many homes with the exception of those within 100 metres of the sediment deposit. A final report commissioned by the BC Government attributed the dam failure to a design flaw, where the foundation was built upon unstable glacial till, exacerbated by the dam being repeatedly raised and expanded.\\t0\\t0\\t0\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t8/12/2014 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t300\\t\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tConflict\\tTerrorist\\tShootings\\tOttawa ON\\t10/22/2014 12:00:00 AM\\tOttawa ON, Oct 22, 2014. At approximately 09:52 EDT, an armed gunman  pulled up in their vehicle to the Ottawa National War Memorial where three Canadian Armed Forces members were posted on Ceremonial Guard sentry duty. The assailant shot at Cpl. Nathan Cirillo striking him twice in the back and fatally wounding him. The assailant then fired at the other sentries as they fled towards the Parliament buildings; but neither of the other sentries were struck or injured. Pulling up to Parliament Hill, the assailant ran from their car and carjacked an idling Parliamentary vehicle on the hill. Members of the RCMP began pursuit as he pulled the vehicle up and ran into the front doors of Parliament. Upon entering, the assailant engaged in a struggle with House of Commons Security Guard Samearn Son, who was shot in the foot in the ensuing struggle. The assailant fled further into the Parliament buildings and was fatally shot by the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Commons, Kevin Vickers. In the ensuing search for additional shooters, many federal government buildings and offices were placed in lockdown. Public institutions such as the University of Ottawa and nearby schools were also placed in lockdown. There were false reports that a third shooting had taken place at the Rideau Centre Mall, fueled by high cellular phone and social media usage that also strained cell towers and communications infrastructure. Government employees were asked to restrict their Blackberry usage for emergencies only until the crisis was over to reduce burden on the system. The following day, Prime Minister Stephen Harper classified the attack as terrorism.\\t2\\t0\\t0\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t10/22/2014 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tFire\\tResidential\\tL?Isle-Verte QC\\t1/23/2014 12:00:00 AM\\tL?Isle-Verte QC, January 23 to February 1 , 2014. A fire broke out overnight in the kitchen of the R?sidence du Havre nursing home that housed 52 seniors with limited mobility. A combination of a lack of installed sprinklers and the wooden construction of the building contributed to the intensity of the fire. Twenty-eight bodies were recovered during the initial search and another four were classified as missing and presumed dead. There were 15 injuries mostly caused by smoke inhalation and carbon monoxide poisoning. In addition, two firefighters were treated for minor injuries. The official Coroner?s report issued February 2015 cited a lack of adequate evacuation and emergency plans, a lack of trained personnel on duty at the facility, and a delay in the firefighter response and backup as factors that contributed to the severity of the disaster. The fire was classified as an accident and no criminal investigation was commenced.\\t32\\t15\\t0\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t2/1/2014 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tNew Brunswick\\t4/15/2014 12:00:00 AM\\tNew Brunswick, April 15 to May 2, 2014. Spring flooding damaged more than 715 homes and businesses, roads, bridges, and other public infrastructure around the province. The majority of property damages were in and around Sussex and Sussex Corner, where 120 homes and 10 businesses were flooded. On April 16, a state of emergency was declared as water breached the banks of the St. John River, causing 1,450 people to evacuate their homes. In Perth-Andover, 23 patients were voluntarily evacuated and transferred to Upper River Valley Hospital. Throughout the rest of the province, swollen rivers led to the closure of several roads and localized flooding.\\t0\\t0\\t1473\\t29603000.0000\\t1418674.1\\t5/2/2014 12:00:00 AM\\t13603000.0000\\t\\t16000000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tConflict\\tTerrorist\\tKidnapping / Murder\\tSaint-Jean-sur-Richelieu QC\\t10/20/2014 12:00:00 AM\\tSaint-Jean-sur-Richelieu QC, October 20-21, 2014. At approximately 11:30 EDT, the lone assailant deliberately rammed their car into a pair of Canadian Armed Forces soldiers in a parking lot of a local shopping Centre, narrowly missing another soldier and a police officer. Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent was transported to hospital with life-threatening injuries and another un-named soldier sustained non-life threatening injuries. Warrant Officer Vincent succumbed to his injuries the next day in hospital. The assailant fled the scene chased by police officers. He eventually lost control of his car and was killed after charging a police officer with a knife. Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the RCMP classified this as a lone-wolf ISIL inspired terrorist attack, unconnected to the shooting on Parliament Hill only two days later.\\t2\\t1\\t0\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t10/21/2014 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tWinter Storm\\tQu?bec\\t12/21/2013 12:00:00 AM\\tQu?bec, December 21-26, 2013. A severe winter storm that formed over the Great Lakes region in Ontario tracked into Qu?bec bringing a mix of freezing rain, ice pellets and snow. The Eastern Townships region of the province was particularly impacted and at its peak, an estimated 51,000 Hydro Qu?bec customers were without power (153,000 individuals). The storm is attributed with the deaths of six people due to a mix of carbon monoxide poisoning and traffic accidents throughout the province. Power was fully restored to all customers by December 26, 2013.\\t6\\t\\t0\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t12/26/2013 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t153000\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tWinter Storm\\tSouthern Ontario\\t12/21/2013 12:00:00 AM\\tSouthern Ontario, ON, December 21, 2013 to January 1, 2014. A severe storm brought freezing rain and damaging ice accumulation across a large area of southern Ontario. According to Environment Canada, the epicentre of the freezing rain was in southern Ontario along the north shore of Lake Ontario, including the Greater Toronto Area, where ice accumulation reached up to 30 mm. The impact of the ice storm on these municipalities and conservation authorities was further exacerbated by freezing temperatures. The ice storm had serious impacts. In its aftermath, as many as 830,000 hydro customers (2,490,000 individuals) across Southern Ontario were without power for several days. Downed trees, broken branches, and downed wires resulting from ice accumulation posed serious public health and safety risks, as well as transportation network problems. Due to widespread power outages and freezing temperatures, municipalities activated emergency plans to open warming centres and canvassed homes of vulnerable residents to ensure their safety. Power was restored to most residences and businesses by January 1, 2014. Response and recovery activities began at the time of the event. The ice storm significantly impacted some of Canada?s largest and most densely populated urban municipalities. Municipalities, provincial ministries and non-governmental organizations such as the Red Cross all acted to respond to the ice storm. Ontario determined that the impacts of the storm were severe enough to warrant implementation of an Ice Storm Assistance Program to help municipalities and conservation authorities with emergency response and recovery costs. Two deaths were attributed to the storm due to carbon monoxide poisoning from improperly ventilated generators and heaters. *Note: A request for federal assistance through the DFAA program has been made; however, no payments have yet been issued.\\t2\\t25\\t0\\t262781642.0000\\t12839493.9\\t1/1/2014 12:00:00 AM\\t98581642.0000\\t\\t4200000.0000\\t160000000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t2490000\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tCumberland House SK\\t4/29/2013 12:00:00 AM\\tCumberland House SK, April 29 to July 03, 2013. Higher-than-normal snow fall and lower temperatures delayed the annual spring melt until the end of April. Over 15 communities declared states of emergencies between April and June as flood waters rose throughout the province. Overland flooding occurred between Moose Jaw and Indian Head, including parts of Regina and south past Weyburn to the U.S border. Significant damage occurred on parts of Highways 2 and 3 that were washed out by the flood waters. Flood waters flowing east on the South Saskatchewan River from Alberta following the June 19 flash floods reached a peak flow of 6000 cubic metres per second, the highest ever recorded, flowing into the Lake Diefenbaker Reservoir. Between June 23 and 28 the Saskatchewan Water Security Agency began releasing water from the reservoir at a rate of 2000 cubic metres per second, leading to a two-metre rise in the river downstream. As a result, 2,200 residents of Cumberland House were evacuated to Prince Albert and Saskatoon. On July 3, 2013 the evacuation order was lifted and residents began to return to the community. *Note: A request for federal assistance through the DFAA program has been made.\\t0\\t0\\t3000\\t43309000.0000\\t2116074.9\\t7/3/2013 12:00:00 AM\\t43309000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tHurricane / Typhoon / Tropical Storm\\tQuebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island\\t7/5/2014 12:00:00 AM\\tQuebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island, July 5-6, 2014. Hurricane Arthur transformed into a powerful Post-Tropical storm over the Maritime provinces. The storm brought powerful wind gusts and heavy rain to Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. The most amount of rain was received in St. Stephen, New Brunswick where it rained up to 143 mm. The strongest winds were felt in Nova Scotia where in Greenwood wind gusts reached up to 140 km/h. In Quebec, severe flooding in Mont-Louis inundated several roads affecting 40 homes, while in Marsoui approximately 30 homes were evacuated (approximately 90 individuals). The powerful winds generated by the storm downed trees and power lines throughout the Maritimes causing power outages, property damage and infrastructure damage. Approximately 290,000 homes and businesses (870,000 individuals) in the Maritimes were without power, while in Quebec approximately 23,000 homes and businesses (69,000 individuals) were reported to have lost power.\\t0\\t0\\t90\\t24712000.0000\\t1184281.2\\t7/6/2014 12:00:00 AM\\t12212000.0000\\t\\t12500000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t939000\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tWinter Storm\\tOntario, Quebec and New Brunswick\\t12/20/2013 12:00:00 AM\\tOntario, Quebec and New Brunswick, December 20, 2013 to January 03, 2014. A severe winter storm system that formed over the Great Lakes Region caused significant damage in Ontario and Quebec before moving east bringing freezing rain, ice pellets, and snow to New Brunswick. Starting December 20, southern Ontario received 20-30 mm of freezing rain during a two-day period. In Quebec, 53,000 people lost power due to the freezing rain, which damaged power lines. By December 23, over 54,000 NB Power customers were without power. A second storm tracked north along the Atlantic coast, bringing up to 30 cm of snow, causing more power outages and delays, which complicated recovery efforts. In total, over 88,000 NB Power customers (approximately 264,000 individuals) lost power over an 11-day period, with the last restorations occurring on January 3, 2014. In total, 11 individuals died during the ice storm from either vehicle accidents or carbon monoxide poisoning from the use of gas generators.\\t0\\t0\\t0\\t214308000.0000\\t10471074.9\\t1/3/2014 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t214308000.0000\\t\\t317000\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tSouthern Quebec\\t4/14/2014 12:00:00 AM\\tQuebec, April 14 to May 1, 2014. A series of intense rainstorms deposited up to 75 mm of rain throughout parts of southern Quebec over a three-day period. Coupled with a delayed spring thaw, the rain caused ice jams and flooding along several rivers in the province. About 300 residents in Sainte-Raymond evacuated including residents from a senior?s home due to raising water levels in the Sainte-Anne River. Many homes situated near the Montmorency River along with homes in Trois-Rivieres, Lennoxville and Weedon were evacuated.

After a relatively quiet spring flood season, heavy rainfall in Western Manitoba and Saskatchewan led to record flows and flooding along the Assiniboine, Qu?Appelle and Souris Rivers. Up to 200 mm of rain fell in some municipalities. Over 43 local states of emergency were declared followed by a provincial state of emergency and formal request for federal assistance on July 4. Approximately 300 Canadian Armed Forces personnel deployed from CFB Shilo to help flood recovery efforts. The Portage Diversion was opened near Portage la Prairie to direct flows from the Assiniboine river into Lake Manitoba. In total, approximately 560 people were evacuated from their homes. The Government of Manitoba estimates that over 920,000 acres of farm land went unseeded for the 2014 season, representing 25 percent of arable acres in Manitoba with an associated estimated cost of over $1 billion dollars. *Note: A request for federal assistance through the DFAA program has been made; however, no payments have yet been issued.\\t0\\t0\\t560\\t1164679000.0000\\t55815287.5\\t7/14/2014 12:00:00 AM\\t164679000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t1000000000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tSouthern Saskatchewan\\t6/25/2014 12:00:00 AM\\tSouthern Saskatchewan, June 25 to July 14, 2014.

The 2015 wildfire season in Saskatchewan featured an unprecedented number of wildfires that consequently caused the biggest fire evacuation effort in Saskatchewan?s history to date. More than 13,000 people from 54 different communities had to be evacuated from their homes in Northern Saskatchewan due to over 720 wildfires that burned nearly 1.8 million hectares of land. The two most severely impacted communities were La Ronge and Montreal Lake. Approximately 7,900 residents of La Ronge Indian Band were forced to evacuate, while in Montreal Lake approximately 1,500 residents evacuated due to several wildfires that destroyed six buildings in the area. Up to 1,500 members of the Canadian Armed Forces were sent to the La Ronge area to assist firefighters.\\t\\t\\t13000\\t92191000.0000\\t4369241.7\\t7/18/2015 12:00:00 AM\\t92191000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tTornado\\tSouthern Ontario\\t8/2/2015 12:00:00 AM\\tSouthern Ontario, August 2-3, 2015. Southern Ontario was struck by three confirmed tornados, two EF2 tornadoes and an EF1 tornado, along with an EF1 downburst and one other unconfirmed tornado sighting. An EF2 tornado touched down in the small town of Teviotdale located 60 kilometres north of Waterloo and another touched down in Lebanon. Wind gusts were reported between 180 to 220 km/h in some areas. The tornado that struck Lebanon caused only minimal damages, however the tornado in Teviotdale left a nine kilometre trail of damage, which downed power lines, destroyed two homes and damaged several other homes and vehicles. The EF1 tornado in Marsville also caused only minimal damages, mostly to trees. In addition, there was a confirmed EF1 downburst in Utica that caused damages to a local Green Tractors John Deere Dealership as well as an unconfirmed tornado in Proton Station that collapsed a tent sending six people to the hospital. Approximately 50,000 hydro customers (150,000 individuals) in southwest Ontario were left without power due to the severe supercell system that caused the tornadoes to form. Residents in several communities throughout southern Ontario experienced strong winds, rain and hail after the tornadoes touched down as a second system moved into the region later in the evening.\\t\\t6\\t\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t8/3/2015 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t150000\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tFort Albany and Kashcewan First Nation\\t4/17/2015 12:00:00 AM\\tFort Albany and Kashechewan First Nation ON, April 17 to May 11, 2015. The annual spring melt resulted in high water levels in the Albany River, which caused severe flooding for communities in the James Bay region. A state of emergency was declared on April 17, for the Kashechewan First Nation, which is situated in the mouth of the Albany River on the shores of James Bay. The community of Fort Albany also declared a state of emergency on April 29. Evacuations in Kashechewan began April 25, where 1,320 residents were air lifted to safety. In Fort Albany, 13 hospital patients were also evacuated by air. On April 27, the Ontario government issued a Request for Federal Assistance (RFA) for aircrafts in response to the flood in order to evacuate the remaining residents. The community of Moose Cree First Nation was also affected but no evacuations took place. In total, 1,333 people were evacuated to Kapuskasing, Smooth Rock Falls, Wawa and Cornwall. Some residents were permanently displaced due to mold and poor living conditions brought on by the reoccurring floods. Evacuation efforts were complete by April 28.\\t\\t\\t1333\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t5/11/2015 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tTransportation accident\\tRail\\tGogama and Mattagami First Nation ON\\t3/7/2015 12:00:00 AM\\tGogama and Mattagami First Nation ON, March 7-9, 2015.

A major storm system formed off the United States east coast and moved towards the north Atlantic. On February 15, the storm system hit Nova Scotia bringing with it snow, ice and rain. In Halifax the weather changed from snow to rain, creating flooding in the streets, which turned into an overnight flash freeze. Greenwood, Nova Scotia received 56 cm of snow, while in Cape Breton Island wind gusts were recorded of up to 176 km/h. The next day in New Brunswick, heavy snow impacted Moncton where it snowed up to 58 cm. The hardest hit area was Prince Edward Island where it snowed over 80 cm in Charlottetown. During the storm, damages were caused by strong winds that downed trees and power lines leaving approximately 4000 customers (12,000 individuals) without power in New Brunswick. Flooding brought on by the rain also caused damages to city streets and created dangerous driving conditions as black ice formed when the temperature dropped. The huge amount of snow that fell on the region buried vehicles, left people stranded in their homes and resulted in the closure of numerous schools and businesses. In New Annan, Prince Edward Island 20 people were left homeless in blizzard conditions as fires irrupted in a motel where 18 people had to be evacuated as well as a home near Winsloe where two people had to be evacuated. In addition, an apartment fire in Fredericton resulted in the evacuation of one individual.\\t\\t\\t21\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t2/17/2015 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t12000\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tStorms and Severe Thunderstorms\\tFredericton NB\\t5/28/2015 12:00:00 AM\\tFredericton NB, May 28-29, 2015.

Perth-Andover experienced significant flooding due to a massive ice jam that broke apart on the St. John and Tobique Rivers. Ice congested local waterways near the village of Perth-Andover causing water levels to rise. The flooding forced 300 people to evacuate. The Canadian Red Cross assisted with the evacuation order. Many businesses closed down, including schools and the local hospital where 23 patients staying at the Hotel Dieu of St. Joseph had to be relocated. Route 105, the major road into Perth-Andover, was closed due to the risk of overland flooding.\\t\\t\\t300\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t4/20/2015 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tStorms and Severe Thunderstorms\\tSouthern Manitoba\\t2/16/2015 12:00:00 AM\\tSouthern Manitoba, May 16-18, 2015. A Colorado low responsible for a tornado outbreak in the United States moved north into Manitoba where it merged with an Artic front. The combined systems created a storm that produced strong winds and heavy rain that eventually turned into ice pellets, snow and hail. On May 17, southern Manitoba was hit with heavy rain and isolated thunderstorms that produced wind gusts of 93 km/h in Winnipeg, 89 km/h in Gimli Harbour and 83 km/h near Brandon. Heavy rain was also reported with the heaviest areas receiving 90 mm in Melita and 83 mm in Bede. The Artic front lowered the temperature causing the rain to turn into freezing rain and snow. MacGregor and Teulon both received 15 cm of snow. Damages were caused by strong winds downing trees and power lines. Approximately 5000 people temporarily lost power during the weekend storm. Heavy rain and snowmelt also caused flooding in certain areas where damage was done to agricultural lands and cottage properties. In addition, the heavy rain caused sewage backups in Winnipeg.\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t2/18/2015 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t5000\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tWildfire\\tBritish Columbia\\t5/9/2015 12:00:00 AM\\tBritish Columbia, May 9 to September 11, 2015. The 2015 wildfire season in British Columbia was the worst on record, in terms of number of fires and hectares burned, to impact the province in 10 years. During the wildfire season that spanned from May to September, over 1,800 fires burned over 300,000 hectares of land. Approximately two thirds of the fires were caused by lighting. The season began early with the discovery of the Little Bobtail Lake fire on May 9. Many fires were within a close proximity of urban areas prompting evacuation orders and alerts across the province. A number of communities were affected by evacuation orders and alerts. Evacuation orders were issued for 141 homes in Joe Rich Kelowna, 70 homes in West Kelowna, 150 homes in Port Hardy and 110 homes in Testalinden, including others. In Puntzi Lake, 90 homes were evacuated and 18 structures were destroyed, while in Rock Creek 330 homes were evacuated and 30 homes as well as 15 other structures were destroyed. Across the province, 1,144 homes (approximately 3,432 individuals) were evacuated due to wildfires. BC Hydro was forced to cut power to certain communities as a precaution, like in West Kelowna where power was cut to 100 customers (approximately 300 individuals). Additional personnel and resources were needed to help battle to above average number of fires burning throughout the province including 310 out-of province firefighters as well as firefighters from Australia, South Africa and the United states. In total, 2,500 firefighters and support workers were working across the province during the peak of the wildfire season. One man was fatally injured while felling a danger tree at the Old Sechelt Mine fire.\\t1\\t\\t3432\\t20401000.0000\\t966872.0\\t9/11/2015 12:00:00 AM\\t20401000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t300\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tStorm - Unspecified / Other\\tLower Mainland British Columbia\\t8/29/2015 12:00:00 AM\\tLower Mainland British Columbia, August 29, 2015. One of the worst windstorms to affect the province in decades hit British Columbia?s Lower Mainland. The most affected areas included Surrey, Richmond, Abbotsford and the Western Fraser Valley. On Saturna Island, wind gusts were report to reached 117 km/h. The powerful winds subsequently fell hundreds of trees, which damaged homes, vehicles and power lines. In total, approximately 500,000 customers (1,500,000 individuals) lost power due to damaged power lines. Some areas lost power temporarily, while others were without power for over three days. Fallen trees caused damages to residential and commercial property. Debris and traffic light outages created severe traffic congestion. There were numerous reports of an undetermined number of people being injured due to fallen trees and debris. One individual was critically injured and taken to the hospital after a tree fell on her while she was outside with her daughter. Additionally, a Vancouver Sky Train was damaged by a fallen tree resulting in service delays. The strong winds that fell hundreds of trees also caused the closure of Stanley Park, Pacific National Exhibition (PNE) and ferry crossings.\\t\\t1\\t\\t34768000.0000\\t1647772.5\\t8/29/2015 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t34768000.0000\\t\\t1500000\\t\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tHazardous Chemicals\\tLeak / Spill Release\\tVancouver BC\\t4/8/2015 12:00:00 AM\\tVancouver BC, April 8, 2015.

Severe thunderstorms affected the southern Alberta region before moving into Saskatchewan. A storm system southwest of Calgary produced a small tornado that touched down in the Tsuu T?ina Nation at 12:53 MTZ as well as multiple funnel clouds, which were spotted in the Calgary area. The impact of the tornado was minimal, however the proximity of the tornado to a highly populated area like Calgary created an extremely high level of risk. Southern areas of Calgary including Canyon Meadows and Lake Bonavista were hit with large hail and as the storm moved east, Hussar, Patricia and Strathmore were impacted by strong wind gusts that downed trees over power lines resulting in localized power outages. A severe thunderstorm warning was in effect at the time meaning that wind gusts exceeded 90 km/h and hail was greater than two cm. The storm later reached Saskatchewan where the town of Kerrobert was hit with severe hail, prompting a state of emergency to be declared. Other communities in Saskatchewan such as Anglin Lake, Francis, Sedley and Regina were impacted by strong winds, heavy rain, hail and lighting. Golf-ball sized hail caused the most significant damages during the storm, including damages to roofs, windows and vehicles.\\t\\t\\t\\t45676000.0000\\t2164739.3\\t7/22/2015 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t45676000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tStorms and Severe Thunderstorms\\tSouthern Alberta\\t8/4/2015 12:00:00 AM\\tSouthern Alberta, August 4-5, 2015.

In late September, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) discovered a case of bovine tuberculosis (TB) found in a cow from Alberta. The USDA then contacted the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) whom initiated an investigation into the outbreak. The investigation found that one herd of cattle in Alberta was infected with TB. The one infected herd was located on 18 separate properties. Within the infected herd there were six confirmed cases of TB, including the cow that was slaughtered in the United states. The infection resulted in the quarantine of approximately 26,000 cattle from approximately 50 different properties in both Alberta and Saskatchewan. As a precaution, approximately 10,000 cattle were destroyed in order to stop the spread of the infection. The infection significantly impacted farmers in Alberta and Saskatchewan. The federal government of Canada offered to pay up to $16.7 million for ranchers who suffered agricultural loses due to the TB outbreak.\\t\\t\\t\\t16700000.0000\\t780373.8\\t12/21/2016 12:00:00 AM\\t16700000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tHazardous Chemicals\\tLeak / Spill Release\\tNorth Saskatchewan River SK\\t7/21/2016 12:00:00 AM\\tNorth Saskatchewan River SK, July 21, 2016. A pipeline from Husky Energy Inc. ruptured spilling up to 250,000 litres of oil mixed with diluent into the North Saskatchewan River. Signs of the leak were first detected on July 20, however after an initial inspection crews reported that no leak was found. The next day the pipeline was shut off as a precaution, after a few hours oil was spotted in the river and an emergency response team was dispatched. The leak that spread hundreds of kilometres downstream contaminated the waterways of the North Saskatchewan River, which is the primary water source for many communities. On July 23 and 25, the contaminated water reached North Battleford and Prince Albert, where a state of emergency was declared, causing both communities to shut off their water supply intake. In addition, the city of Melfort and the town of Star City were put on a boil-water advisory. Multiple First Nation communities were affected including Muskaday First Nation, which declared a state of local emergency on July 27. As of July 29, oil ceased to be released from the source site and the spill was 40-50 per cent recovered. The spill caused severe environmental damages and clean-up efforts ran the risk of disrupting approximately 3000 archaeological sites located along the waterways.\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t7/21/2016 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tRed Earth First Nation SK\\t11/14/2016 12:00:00 AM\\tRed Earth First Nation SK, July 14-18, 2016.

A storm system tracked its way northeast into the Great Lakes from the United States in late February. The system moved towards eastern Canada, causing widespread damages to Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland. On February 24, freezing rain caused up to 25 mm of ice accumulation to build in parts of Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick. On February 25, Quebec and New Brunswick experienced several hours of continued freezing rain. Heavy rain and thunderstorms trailed behind the freezing rain resulting in total rainfalls of 51 mm in Hamilton, Ontario, 36 mm in Lennoxville, Quebec and 68 mm in Gray River, Newfoundland. A combination of rain and mild weather that melted ice and snow resulted in localized flooding for numerous communities. Flooded basements were reported in Cornwall, Ontario, multiple underpasses were closed due to flooding in Montreal, Quebec, while local fire departments in northern New Brunswick warned drivers of poor road conditions due to ice ruts and isolated flooding. Multiple local states of emergency were declared in the Eastern Townships of Quebec where ice breakup resulted in the flooding of local rivers. Approximately 200 residents were evacuated and over 50 homes in Beauceville, Quebec were damaged by floodwaters. Fallen trees weighed down by the heavy ice and snow damaged power lines resulting in widespread power outages. Quebec was hit the hardest with over 250,000 hydro customers (approximately 750,000 individuals) affected by the power outages.\\t\\t\\t200\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t2/26/2016 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t750000\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tWinter Storm\\tSouthern Ontario\\t3/23/2016 12:00:00 AM\\tSouthern Ontario, March 23-26, 2016.

The articulated barge and tug, Nathan E. Stewart, ran aground near Bella Bella in the Seaforth Channel. The tug, which contained 215,000 litres of diesel, began taking on water resulting in the empty barge breaking free from the tug. The tug was partially submerged and two of its fuel tanks were breached causing fuel to leak into the waters off the coast of the Great Bear Rainforest. The barge and tug, which were owned by the U.S. company Kirby Offshore Marine, were travelling south from Alaska. On October 14, two aerial flights confirmed that the sheen had spread throughout the Gale passage. Protection and containment efforts consisted of absorbent booms that were deployed around the damaged tug and booming along the Gale Passage, which included the application of petroleum sorbent. A dive team partially repaired sections of the breached fuel tanks to reduce the leakage while workers attempted to pump out the remaining fuel inside. Clean up and salvage recovery efforts were hindered by bad weather. It was not until November 15 when the tug was finally lifted out of the water and taken to shore on a salvage barge. It is estimated that 108,000 litres of fuel and 2,240 litres of lubricants were spilled. Most impacted by the leak was the Heiltsuk First Nation who closed local clam fisheries due to environmental concerns.\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t10/13/2016 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tNortheastern British Columbia\\t6/15/2016 12:00:00 AM\\tNortheastern British Columbia, June 15-17, 2016.

Wildfires burning around Edmonton destroyed two homes, injured two firefighters and destroyed one fire truck.\\t\\t2\\t164\\t0.0000\\t0.0\\t4/21/2016 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tFort McMurray AB\\t7/30/2016 12:00:00 AM\\tFort McMurray AB, July 30-31 2016. Only weeks after the devastating wildfire that swept through the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, the city of Fort McMurray was struck by a flash flood, which caused damages to personal property as well as disrupted local traffic and recovery efforts. On July 31, Fort McMurray received up to 85 mm of rain, which caused significant damages to approximately 41 homes. The flood occurred at a time when Fort McMurray was undergoing recovery efforts in response to the May wildfires that caused the evacuation of the entire city. The flash flood also caused road closures and knocked out power to traffic lights.\\t\\t\\t\\t462528000.0000\\t21613457.9\\t7/31/2016 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t462528000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tWildfire\\tFort McMurray AB\\t4/30/2016 12:00:00 AM\\tFort McMurray AB, April 30 to June 1, 2016. In May 2016, wildfires broke out in northern Alberta resulting in the most expensive natural disaster in the history of Canada. The city of Fort McMurray, located in the heart of the Athabasca oil sands, was hit by a massive system of wildfires that swept through the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo. The first wildfire was discovered on April 30, north of Fort McMurray. The Regional Municipality declared a local state of emergency and a mandatory evacuation order for Centennial Park on May 1 as well as another evacuation order for Prairie Creek and Centennial Trailer Park on May 2. The Fort McMurray fire grew rapidly due to hot and dry weather conditions, doubling in size to 2,656 hectares in a manner of hours. On May 3, the wildfire intensified and crossed over Highway 63, cutting off the route to evacuees, prompting the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation to declare a state of local emergency and a mandatory evacuation order for Fort McMurray?s Lower Townsite and downtown area, which included the communities of Gregoire, Beacon Hill, Abasand, Waterways, Draper, Saline Creek, Grayling Terrace, Thickwood, Wood Buffalo and Dickinsfield. Later in the day the entire city of Fort McMurray was under a mandatory evacuation order. During the evacuations two people were killed in a car crash. On May 4, the Alberta government declared a provincial state of emergency. The Fort McMurray fire quickly grew to 85,000 hectares as the wildfire spread further north and east eventually passing through Fort McMurray. Evacuees that fled north of Fort McMurray had to be air lifted to safety. Some evacuees were taken to Lac La Biche, while the majority where sent to Edmonton and Calgary. On May 10, two of the main Fort McMurray fires joined together and formed a massive blaze of 229,000 hectares. On May 16, all workers in work camps and oil sand operations north of Fort McMurray were forced to move south as the wildfire spread further north. Residents of Fort McMurray were allowed to return home on June 1. In total, the Fort McMurray fires burned approximately 579,767 hectares of land causing the evacuation of over 90,000 people and destroyed 2,400 homes and business, including 530 other buildings that were damaged. At its peak, there were over 2000 firefighters working the fires daily, including helicopters and water bombers. In addition, firefighters received help from 200 firefighters from the United States, 60 from Mexico and 298 from South Africa. Firefighters and emergency response personnel received help from the Canadian Red Cross who assisted with evacuation efforts.\\t2\\t\\t90000\\t4068678000.0000\\t190125140.2\\t6/1/2016 12:00:00 AM\\t468678000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t3600000000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tWindsor, Ontario\\t8/28/2017 12:00:00 AM\\tRain began to fall on August 28th and within 48 hours ? 222 mm fell southwest of Windsor, 140-200 mm in Riverside-Tecumseh, and 285 mm in Lasalle.

Several public facilities and businesses were also impacted including schools and libraries. Thousands of basements were flooded which resulted in over $173 million in insurance payouts.\\t\\t\\t\\t173000000.0000\\t\\t8/30/2017 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t173000000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tWinter Storm\\tNewfoundland\\t3/11/2017 12:00:00 AM\\tA series of slow-moving winter storms impacted Newfoundland on March 1-2 and March 11th. Although hurricane-force winds were recorded during the March 1-2 storms, it was the March 11th storm that was the most notable. This storm, also called the Brier Blast, recorded wind gusts of up to 190 km/hr at Bay de Verde in the Avalon Peninsula. In St. John?s, the city had to replace 142 traffic lights which affected 72 intersections. Newfoundland Power reported that 70,000 customers were impacted by power outages. The high wings uprooted trees, tore off roofs and brought down power lines and traffic lights. There were 4,500 claims and $60 million in insurable losses.\\t\\t\\t\\t60000000.0000\\t\\t3/11/2017 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t60000000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tWildfire\\tBritish Columbia\\t7/7/2017 12:00:00 AM\\tCanada?s western region, including British Columbia, experienced record-breaking hot and dry weather. Up until 2017, this was the worst fire season on record. From July 6-8, a total of 190 fires started - 108 fires on July 7th alone. For the first time in 15 years, there was a province-wide State of Emergency which lasted 70 days and was the longest in BC?s history. At the end of the season, there was a reported 1,265 fires that burned 1.2 million hectares of land; 30% more than the previous record. At the peak of fire activity, there were 4,700 personnel fighting wildfires across the province including 1,200 out-of-province personnel from Australia, Mexico, New Zealand, the United States, and other provinces and territories. For the first time since 2003, the Canadian Armed Forces were also brought in. Over 300 structures burned in addition to 100s of power poles and transmission towers. The total cost of this record-breaking fire season is estimated to be over $700 million, including over $568 million in firefighting costs and $130 million in insured property losses. Some of the notable fires were: The Plateau Complex fires in which 20 fires merged on the Chilcotin Plateau and burned 545,151 ha of land ? the same size as PEI and the largest in BC?s recorded history. The Elephant Hill fire was exceptionally devastating and burned 123 homes, and significantly impacted 23 First Nation communities. The Central Cariboo Complex fire measured 31,181 ha led to the evacuation order of the city of Williams Lake which has a population of over 10,000 people.\\t\\t\\t65000\\t130000000.0000\\t\\t9/15/2017 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t130000000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tEastern Canada\\t5/4/2017 12:00:00 AM\\tA combination of significant rainfall from May 4-7, overland flow, and high water levels led to extensive flooding across in parts of eastern Canada. Montreal and the National Capital Region experienced their wettest springs in recorded history with over +400 mm of rainfall. Several communities declared States of Emergency including Gatineau, Montreal, and many smaller towns. The Canadian military deployed 4,000 personnel to help with the flood efforts. The event caused significant losses including over $116 million in insured damage, and 550 damaged roads. Two people were killed in floodwaters in the Sainte-Anne River (Gaspe region).\\t2\\t\\t4000\\t116000000.0000\\t\\t5/7/2017 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t116000000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tWinter Storm\\tNew Brunswick\\t1/24/2017 12:00:00 AM\\tA winter storm significantly impacted central, south-central, eastern and north-eastern New Brunswick as well as the Acadian Peninsula. Regions that were hardest hit were the Counties of Kent, Northumberland and Gloucester. Ice accumulation on power lines and poles caused over 600 poles to collapse. NB Power reported 130,000 customers that were without power (which is roughly 286,000 residents); some homes were without power for 12 days. Nearly a third of New Brunswick residents were impacted. The communities of Saint Marie-Saint Raphael, Le Goulet, Lameque and Tracadie-Sheila declared States of Local Emergency. The Canadian Armed Forces were deployed to help with the storm efforts. It is suspected that the unsafe use of generators and heating devices led to 2 deaths and 45 related illnesses/injuries. The storm also impacted parts of Quebec and Atlantic Canada ? the Gaspe region recorded a storm surge and local flooding, and Halifax had 100 km/hr winds.\\t2\\t45\\t\\t0.0000\\t\\t1/26/2017 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t286000\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tWinter Storm\\tChurchill, Manitoba\\t3/7/2017 12:00:00 AM\\tA 3-day winter storm dropped 60 cm of snow with wind gusts of 120 km/hr and zero visibility.

Emergency services, critical facilities and VIA Rail service all experienced significant disruptions.  Following the event, the Town of Churchill declared a State of Local Emergency. The blizzard also affected other parts of Manitoba.\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0000\\t\\t3/9/2017 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tBritish Columbia\\t4/27/2017 12:00:00 AM\\tFollowing a relatively cold and dry winter, the Southern Interior region of British Columbia experienced a wetter than average spring. A late snowfall and rain accumulation led to saturated soils, overland flow, and slope instability throughout areas of the south and central Okanagan as well as the Kootenay and Shuswap regions. The flooding led to 2,500 evacuations which were mostly from the Okanagan. Numerous States of Local Emergencies were declared. 15 First Nation communities were impacted where the flooding damaged homes and infrastructure. The flood response costs alone were estimated to be $73 million.\\t\\t\\t2500\\t0.0000\\t\\t6/15/2017 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tStorms and Severe Thunderstorms\\tSaskatoon\\t6/2/2017 12:00:00 AM\\tA fast-moving severe storm with ping pong-sized hail struck the Saskatoon area.

At the end of the season, there was a reported 2,091 fires that burned over 1.35 million hectares of land; more than the previous record. A provincial State of Emergency was declared on August 15th and eventually cancelled on September 7th. In August during the peak of the fire season, over 10 million Canadians were exposed to exposed to smoke-polluted air ? Calgary had 478 hours of smoke and haze which is almost 40 times their normal amount.\\t\\t\\t3200\\t0.0000\\t\\t9/7/2018 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tWildfire\\tOntario\\t7/3/2018 12:00:00 AM\\t2018 was an exceptionally busy fire season in Ontario with nearly twice as many fires and more than double the burned area than the 10-year average. At the end of the season, there was a reported 1,325 fires that burned over 275,000 ha of land. In July alone, 549 fires were recorded. Over 900 out-of-province personnel were brought in from 9 provinces and territories, the United States and Mexico. Some of the most notable fires were: Nipigon 30 which was the largest fire and burned almost 33,000 ha; and both Parry Sound 33 and the Temagami fire cluster led to multiple evacuation orders of communities, the closure of provincial parks, and air quality advisories.\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0000\\t\\t9/1/2018 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tGrand River, ON\\t2/16/2018 12:00:00 AM\\tThe winter of 2018 was one of the coldest on record, which created a very strong icepack throughout the Grand River watershed in Ontario. In addition to this, temperature drops led to the formation of frazil ice ? heavy slush in rivers. On February 19th, 40-60 mm of rain fell. The combination of frazil ice, ice jams, 40-60 mm of rain, and 50-70mm of melting snowpack caused the water levels of the Grand River to rise rapidly. Ice jams tended to form in Cambridge, Brantford and Cayuga ? in Cambridge the ice jam measured 5 km upstream. The Grand River Conservation Authority issued flood warnings for several communities including Brantford, Cambridge, North Dumfries and Brant County. The first warning was issued on February 16th but by February 18th a warning was issued for the entire watershed. Up to 2,200 homes and 4,900 residents were impacted by an evacuation order. In Cambridge, ice and debris damaged city infrastructure, communications and a water main. The City of Brantford declared a State of Emergency. Along the Grand River near Orangeville, a young boy drowned in the floodwaters.\\t1\\t\\t4900\\t0.0000\\t\\t2/21/2018 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tNew Brunswick\\t4/27/2018 12:00:00 AM\\tIn early April, the deep snowpacks in parts of New Brunswick were exposed to over 48 hours of warm temperatures of up to 29C. In addition, a total of 152 mm of rain fell over a period of 31 of 32 days. Widespread flooding in the St. John River basin deeply impacted several communities including its capital of Fredericton. Every community along the St. John River between Fredericton and St. John experienced high water levels. On April 27th, the water level along the St. John River reached flood stage in Fredericton and Maugerville. By April 30th, the river was above flood stage between Fredericton and St. John. The flood peaked on May 6th from Maugerville to Sheffield-Lakeville Corner, and from the latter to St. John on May 7th reaching record-breaking flood stages for most of these stations. There were significant disruptions to the transportation network including 150 impacted provincial roads, eroded roadways, weight restrictions on bridges and the closure of parts of the trans-Canada highway between Fredericton and Moncton. According to the Red Cross, as of January 2019, there were 33 individuals still displaced from these floods. According to Environment and Climate Change Canada, this flood was the largest and most impactful flood in modern New Brunswick history.\\t\\t\\t1400\\t0.0000\\t\\t5/13/2018 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tHeat Event\\tQuebec\\t6/30/2018 12:00:00 AM\\tRecord-breaking heat was measured across Canada and in parts of southern Ontario and Quebec.

The winter storm caused widespread school and flight cancellations, and power failures impacted 57,000 clients.\\t\\t\\t\\t39000000.0000\\t\\t1/25/2019 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t39000000.0000\\t\\t57000\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tEastern Canada\\t4/18/2019 12:00:00 AM\\tExtensive flooding in April and May was experienced across Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick due to a combination of heavy rainfalls and snow melt. In the Beauce region of Quebec, 154.5 mm of rain fell in April and was one of the first regions to be impacted by the spring floods. The most severe flooding took place in Quebec where there were over 10,000 evacuees and over 6,600 flooded homes. One person was killed in Pontiac, QC, after the road washed out. In Sainte-Marthe-sur-le-Lac, a suburb of Montreal in the Deux-Montagnes MRC, a 15-23 m rupture in the natural dyke system forced the immediate evacuation of over 5,000 residents and 50 streets were flooded overnight on April 27-28th. Historical water levels were also experienced at the Chute-Bell hydro dam along Riviere Rouge where 50 residents of Grenville-sur-la-Rouge were evacuated due to fears of a dam failure. States of emergency extended across the 3 provinces, including in Ottawa and Montreal. By the end of April, over a dozen states of emergency had been declared along the Ottawa River and its tributaries alone. Around 2,000 Canadian Forces personnel were deployed, which was more than the number deployed overseas.\\t1\\t\\t10000\\t0.0000\\t\\t4/18/2019 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tKashechewan, Ontario\\t4/15/2019 12:00:00 AM\\tSeasonal flooding along the Albany River forced the evacuation of Kashechewan First Nation, a community of 2,500, to various communities throughout Ontario including Timmins, Kapuskasing, Thunder Bay and Cornwall.

The winter storm produced warm temperatures and rain which caused signifncant flooding in parts of Ontario such as Bolton and Caledon along the Humber River, and in Quebec. The storm moved through Quebec and into the Maritimes on the 15th and continued to bring rain and wind. It is estimated that the storm caused $124 million in insured losses ($63 million in Quebec, $53 million in Ontario, $6.6 million in Nova Scotia, and $1.8 million in New Brunswick).\\t\\t\\t\\t124000000.0000\\t\\t3/14/2019 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t124000000.0000\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tOld Man River, Alberta\\t7/9/1902 12:00:00 AM\\t1902 was one of the wettest years on record in the Old Man River valley in Alberta which led to three floods - May 22, June 2, and July 9. The worst of the three was in July with an estimated peak flow of 140,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) and 8.2 m (27 ft.) above normal river levels. As a result of these floods, the width of the river widened. There were also significant losses to the community, such as damage to the Belly River Bridge (now Old Man River), the destruction of several homes, and a decrease in population.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t7/9/1902 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tTransportation accident\\tMarine\\tOff Horse Islands, Newfoundland\\t3/15/1931 12:00:00 AM\\tA film crew including New York producer and director Varick Frissell boarded the \"SS Viking\" sealing ship to record extra footage for their upcoming film \"White Thunder\" (renamed \"The Viking\").

The blowout shot oil 45 m into the air and sprayed fields as far as 5 kilometres away; natural gas also leaked. While the well blowout was creating 10,000-15,000 barrels of oil per day, the uncontrollable release spewed 1.4 million barrels and over a billion cubic metres of natural gas into the air and surrounding farmland. Unprecedented efforts were made to plug the blowout - with everything from cement to chicken feathers - as well as the drilling of relief wells but with no avail.  On September 6th, the well caught fire, and with 16 ha of land burning, the fire could be seen from 64 km away. The fire burned for 3 days, but the blowout was not contained until November 9th. As a result of the blowout, the contaminated fields in the surrounding area took decades to return to productive farmland. Significant changes to safety standards and regulations came into place following this event.\\t0\\t0\\t\\t\\t\\t11/9/1948 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tTransportation accident\\tRail\\tSand Point, Ontario\\t2/9/1904 12:00:00 AM\\tOn February 9th, 2 passenger trains collided head-on near Sand Point, ON.

The community power plant closed for a week, and the water supply was temporarily halved, causing over 150 individuals to be evacuated. As a result of this flood, Lethbridge rezoned the residential area in the floodplain to parkland (now Indian Battle Park), and encouraged several residents to relocate outside of the floodplain.\\t0\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t6/10/1953 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tOld Man River, Alberta\\t6/6/1908 12:00:00 AM\\tIn June of 1908, Old Man River in Alberta experienced one of its highest peak flows in history; caused by heavy rains and an already saturated ground because of snowmelt. On June 6th, the peak flow was estimated to be 200,000 cubic feet per second (cfs)\\xa0, and 8 m (26.7 ft.) above normal river levels. Due to the floods of 1902, the river had widened, therefore the flood of 1908 had a higher volume of water but a slightly less height above normal. Regardless, the 1908 flood caused significant losses to several communities such as Lethbridge and McLeod, AB.

A firebreak was successfully created by dynamite which saved a part of the town. Also a concerted and successful effort was made to save the livery barn filled with horses. There was only 1 fatality and $750,000 (1900 CAD) in losses - 10 hotels, a bank, several local businesses, 2 churches and numerous homes were destroyed leaving most of the town homeless (estimated 1,200 individuals).\\t1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t5/4/1900 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tGeomagnetic Storm\\tAcross Canada\\t10/31/1903 12:00:00 AM\\tOn October 31st, a geomagnetic storm that lasted for 8 hours created significant disruptions to the telegraph, telephone and cable systems around the world.  \\t0\\t0\\t\\t\\t\\t11/1/1903 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tTransportation accident\\tAir\\tVancouver, British Columbia\\t4/28/1947 12:00:00 AM\\tOn April 28th, a Trans-Canada Air Lines flight from Lethbridge, AB, to Vancouver, BC, went missing near Vancouver.

Since cars and streetcars were buried by the snow, Victoria reverted back to horses: the fire and police departments used horse-drawn sleighs, merchants converted their wagons to sleighs to make deliveries, milkmen strapped cans of milk to horses, and a local blacksmith created a steel snowplough to be pulled by horses. The winter to date had been cold, and the coal supply was already low leaving many families to burn trees in their yards and wooden fences; several families stayed in hotels. Roughly 800-1,000 soldiers training at a nearby base helped shovel snow, in addition to 150 hired labourers. Fifty men even pulled a wooden snowplough to help clear the streets.

In August, a state of emergency was declared on the 1st, and 3,800 residents  were evacuated from Barriere, McLure, and Louis Creek, BC. Because the main highway was closed, the evacuations had to be via ferry or on a route that climbed 1,311 m in elevation. Up to this date, BC had an exceptional fire season with 189 fires burning at the same time. Since fire response resources were stretched across the province, out-of-province and military personnel were brought in to help in the fire effort. The Canadian Armed Forces \\'Operation Peregrine\\' provided firefighting assistance for 45 days from early August to October 5th; roughly 400 personnel assisted with the McClure fire. By August 27th, 1,079 firefighters were fighting the fire. The fire lasted for over 75 days, burned 26,240 ha (262 km2) including 72 homes and 9 businesses. The losses were estimated to be $31 million (CAD 2005) and $8.2 million in property damage. Additionally, the loss of a sawmill in Louis Creek led to the more than 180 employees permanently losing their jobs. In British Columbia, the insured losses of this fire season were $200 million (2003 CAD).\\t0\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t10/13/2003 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tTransportation accident\\tMarine\\tLake Timiskaming\\t6/11/1978 12:00:00 AM\\tOn June 11th, a group of 27 school children and 4 adult leaders from St. John\\'s Private School were on year end school canoe trip on Lake Timiskaming, ON, when the winds capsized their canoes.

After an inspection, it was decided to let the 80 ha fire burn freely. According to the policy at the time, fire crews were not allowed to suppress fires until they were within a certain distance of a road, community or major river. Even though local Metis trappers volunteered to help suppress the fire as it moved towards and into Alberta, fire crews were ordered not to go. A second fire began on July 29th, and eventually joined the Whisp fire between September 20 and 22nd. By this time, there were over 30 fires greater than 200 ha burning along the northern borders of BC and Alberta; the newly-merged Chinchaga fire spread 63 km. The smoke plume drifted from northern Alberta to southern Ontario which caused high mid-day electricity demand to turn on the lights and subsequently led to several power outages. The Whisp/Chinchaga fires burned 1.4 million ha (14,000 km2) and was recorded as the largest wildfire in North American history. The majority of the burned area was in Alberta; only 90,000 ha were in BC.\\t0\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t10/4/1950 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tFire\\tNon-Residential\\tWinnipeg, Manitoba\\t6/8/1954 12:00:00 AM\\tOn June 8th, at 1:18am (local), the Winnipeg fire department responded to a call of a small fire behind a neon sign at the Time Building—a 7-storey building near Portage Avenue and Hargrave Street.

All firetrucks in the department (except 2) were dispatched to the large fire, which was eventually contained by the end of the morning. In the end, the fire destroyed over 100 businesses and caused an estimated $2-$3 million (1954 CAD) in losses in addition to almost $35,000 in municipal costs (demolition, fire equipment).

It was an ideal fire season for the area; the winter of 1919 had a low snowfall, followed by an early spring drought, and hot and dry conditions in May. Within hours, the entire community had burned  down, except for the local inn, church, train station and a few other buildings. Property damage and inventory losses were estimated to be over $200,000 (1919 CAD). This fire, however, was part of a larger complex that stretched to Prince Albert, SK, and Meadow Lake, SK (over 300 km east). In total, the fire burned over 2 million ha (20,000 km2) of forest. Indigenous lands and people were also deeply affected by this fire. For example, the fire reached a small Cree hunting party on Sekip Lake, SK, resulting in the death of 11 individuals, and the injury of 12 others.\\t11\\t12\\t\\t\\t\\t5/28/1919 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tBiological\\tEpidemic\\tAlberta\\t5/20/2003 12:00:00 AM\\tOn May 20th, it was announced that a single breeder cow in northern Alberta tested positive for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Within hours, countries that imported Canadian beef imposed trade bans. From May 2003 to May 2005, it is estimated that the Canadian beef sector lost over $2.5 billion.\\t0\\t0\\t\\t\\t\\t5/20/2003 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t2500000000.0000\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tFire\\tNon-Residential\\tCobalt, Ontario\\t5/23/1977 12:00:00 AM\\tOn May 23rd, a fire broke near Rowden\\'s Hardware store in Cobalt, ON. The fire quickly spread and over 100 volunteer firefighters from surrounding communities helped in the fire suppression efforts. In the end, the fire destroyed 140 buildings and left 459 individuals homeless. The estimated losses were $4 million (1977 CAD). Many residents did not rebuild in Cobalt; between the 1971 and 1981 Census, the population of Cobalt dropped by almost 20%.\\t0\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t5/23/1977 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tPort Arthur, Ontario\\t5/28/1908 12:00:00 AM\\tOn May 28th, heavy rains caused the Paquette electricity Dam along the Current River in Ontario to fail. Roughly 200 million cubic feet of water was released down river and into Port Arthur, ON. As a result, the floodwaters destroyed kilometres of Canadian Pacific Railway tracks, caused other property and infrastructure damage, and derailed a freight train. The dam failure killed 5 individuals, all of whom were on the freight train, and caused an estimated $500,000 (1908 CAD) in losses.\\t5\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t5/28/1908 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tStorm - Unspecified / Other\\tCalgary, Alberta\\t11/27/2011 12:00:00 AM\\tOn November 27th, a windstorm resulted in serious impacts across the Calgary area, including impeding traffic in the downtown core.

In 1972, Lake Erie was already at record high levels. During the storm, water gages registered a 2.4 m (8 ft) difference in water level between Buffalo, NY and Toledo, Ohio. This event led to significant property damage along the shoreline; an estimated $22 million (USD 1973).\\t0\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t11/15/1972 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tStorm - Unspecified / Other\\tVancouver, British Columbia\\t11/15/2006 12:00:00 AM\\tOn November 15th, over 150 mm of rain fell on Vancouver in 15 hours. By noon, 7 provincial highways were blocked with eight communities experiencing power outages. Additionally, several landslides in Vancouver water reservoirs created a risk of water contamination resulting in a boil water advisory for 2 million residents in Vancouver and its surrounding area. While the advisory was partially lifted the next day, almost a million residents in Vancouver, Burnaby, and the North Shore remained under a boil water advisory for 10 more days. This was the largest water warning in Canadian history. This storm and a series of storms over the next month would lead to over $133 million (CAD 2006) in insured losses.\\t0\\t0\\t\\t\\t\\t11/15/2006 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t133086000.0000\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tTransportation accident\\tRail\\tToronto, Ontario\\t11/19/1997 12:00:00 AM\\tOn November 19th at 4:16pm (local), 2 GO trains collided in Toronto.

Additionally, the road leading up to the bridge was flooded, so homesteaders passing through along the \\'trail\\' had to stay in tents for 2 weeks waiting for the water to recede.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t6/1/1904 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tFire\\tNon-Residential\\tWinnipeg, Manitoba\\t11/25/1922 12:00:00 AM\\tJust after 2:00am (local) on November 25th, the St. Boniface College - a Jesuit boarding school - caught fire. The school, built in 1882, housed 195 staff and students as well as a large collection of historical artifacts and documents. Many students and staff were instrumental in the rescue efforts,  9 students (mostly under the age of 16) and one clergyman perished in the fire, with a further 18 sustaining injuries. The collection of historical items were also destroyed.\\t10\\t18\\t\\t\\t\\t11/25/1922 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tFlood\\tSkeena River, British Columbia\\t5/29/1936 12:00:00 AM\\tDuring the last week of May, the temperatures soared to over 30 Celsius causing snowmelt and flooding conditions across BC, the Yukon and Alaska. The Skeena, Columbia and Thompson Rivers reached record levels. The Skeena River changed its course in several places including Terrace, BC, which led to severe erosion—for instance, one farm lost 4.8 ha in 3 days. The communities of Usk and Remo were significantly impacted. In Usk, the flood waters were 1.8-3 m high and only 3 buildings in the community were not damaged. In Remo, the water was 2.4 m, and only 1 house was not damaged. The Skeena River also carved new river channels including one through the community of Kispiox, and with it, 20 buildings. Several infrastructure was damaged including hundreds of meters of rail lines, at least 22 bridges, community powerhouses, 10 km of telephone and telegraph lines, kilometers of roadways and ferry infrastructure. Damage to roads, bridges and ferry infrastructure was $35,100 (CAD 1916); $21,305 alone was in the Terrace-Kitwanga area.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t6/3/1936 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tHurricane / Typhoon / Tropical Storm\\tAtlantic Canada\\t9/15/1996 12:00:00 AM\\tIn the early morning hours of September 15th, Hurricane Hortense made landfall near Sheet Harbour, NS— the first hurricane to made landfall in Nova Scotia in 21 years. At landfall, Hortense was a category 1 hurricane with winds near 120 km/hr. Hortense quickly downgraded to a tropical storm, and transitioned to a post-tropical storm to the south of Newfoundland by the afternoon of the 15th. The maximum recorded wind speed was 161 km/hr near St. Paul Island in the Cabot Strait, the maximum rainfall was 95-137.5 mm, there were 8 m waves near the Halifax Harbour as well as a 0.75 m storm surge were recorded in or near Halifax (it was over 1m east of Halifax). Hortense caused numerous power outages, damage to windows and roofs as well as flooding. The total property losses were almost $5 million.\\t0\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t9/15/1996 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tMeteorological - Hydrological\\tStorms and Severe Thunderstorms\\tCentral Alberta\\t8/7/2014 12:00:00 AM\\tOn August 7th, a system of severe thunderstorms tracked east towards Calgary and Medicine Hat. The system brought both strong winds and large hail which measured up to the size of a baseball. The hardest hit area was Airdrie where 6 individuals were hospitalized and almost every household reported damage. The impacted area stretched across 250 km of central Alberta and was one of the largest hail-stricken areas from a single storm in 20 years. The storm caused over half a billion dollars in insured damage.\\t0\\t6\\t\\t\\t\\t8/8/2014 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t546468000.0000\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nDisaster\\tNatural\\tBiological\\tInfestation\\tBritish Columbia\\t1/1/2005 12:00:00 AM\\tIn 2005, the mountain pine beetle infestation in British Columbia peaked and 140 million cubic metres (m3) of pine were \\'attacked\\'.

At the time, there was a construction camp along the river to house workers building the highway between Prince Rupert and Terrace, BC. In the days leading up to the avalanche, a storm dropped rain that changed to snow at the camp. At 7:30am (local) on the 11th, the first of three avalanches impacted the camp. Two bunkhouses and the first aid shack were destroyed. Soon thereafter, the second avalanche struck, and destroyed most of the camp leaving only two buildings standing. Twenty minutes later, a third avalanche occurred, and destroyed the construction office. Three individuals were killed and 11 were severely injured. Ten years prior to this event, a snow shed covering the rail tracks was destroyed by an avalanche at the same location. This fact was overlooked by the highway construction managers who sited the camp at the same location.\\t3\\t11\\t\\t\\t\\t2/11/1943 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tTransportation accident\\tMarine\\tDouglas Island, Alaska\\t8/15/1901 12:00:00 AM\\tOn the evening of August 14th, the \"SS Islander\", a steamer owned by the Canadian Pacific Steam Navigation Company, left Skagway, Alaska, en route to Vancouver.

This earthquake was felt as far as Portland, Oregon, Prince Rupert, BC, and in the Rocky Mountains. Nearby communities such as Courtenay, Campbell River, Cumberland and Union Bay experienced considerable damage; 75% of chimneys were thrown down in some communities.  Chimney damage was noted as far as Victoria. A chimney collapse at an elementary school in Courtenay fell into the building, through the roof and onto the desks of a classroom below - luckily the earthquake occurred outside of school hours. The earthquake also caused soil failure, landslides and a landslide-generated displacement wave (tsunami). The tsunami affected parts of the Georgia Strait and nearby inlets; the maximum wave height was 2 m. Of the 2 deaths reported, one was a heart attack in Seattle, the other was a drowning when a boat capsized in the displacement wave near Mapleguard Point.\\t2\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t6/23/1946 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\nIncident\\tTechnology\\tFire\\tNon-Residential\\tWhitehorse, Yukon\\t5/23/1905 12:00:00 AM\\tOn the morning of May 23rd, a fire broke out in the barber shop of the Windsor Hotel in Whitehorse, YT.

Although the wreckage lies in international waters along the Newfoundland Ridge (off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland), this disaster did impact Canadians and Canada. At 11:40pm on the night of April 14th, Titanic struck and iceberg, breaching 6 of its 16 watertight compartments. Only 2 hours and 40 minutes after striking the iceberg, Titanic sank at 2:20am in the early morning of the 15th.  There were roughly 2,222 passengers and crew on board; only 705 survived. Of the 34 Canadians on board, 20 of them perished. Among the dead included Harry Molson, the inheritor of the Molson Brewing company, and Charles Melville Hays, the president of the Grand Trunk Railway and governor of McGill University. On Wednesday April 17th, the Cable Steamer Mackay-Bennett was dispatched from Halifax in the recovery effort. After arriving at the wreckage site on April 20th, the crew spent 5 days recovering over 300 bodies. On April 26th, the Minia, another cable ship from Halifax, relieved the former and continued operations. After 8 days, a further 17 bodies were recovered.  Two more Canadian ships, the CGS Montmagny and the SS Algerine would continue the efforts and recover 5 more bodies. A temporary morgue was established at the Mayflower Curling Rink in Halifax. In total, 119 individuals were buried at sea, the remains of 59 were claimed and privately buried by relatives, and 150 bodies were buried in three cemeteries in Halifax: Fairview Lawn, Mount Olivet and Baron de Hirsch.\\t20\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t4/15/1912 12:00:00 AM\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0.0\\t\\r\\n'"
